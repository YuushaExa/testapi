With an expansive story and many different choices, Ghosts over the Water takes you into a fast-paced world filled with difficult decisions.\n\nIt is the summer of 1853; a group of unexpected visitors have arrived on Japanese shores. A powerful fleet of ships commanded by Commodore Matthew C. Perry has stormed into Edo Bay, causing panic and threatening the possibility of violence. Over two hundred years have passed since Japan‚Äôs borders were closed, limiting trade to Chinese and Dutch merchants. Now an American fleet is at the country‚Äôs shores demanding trade and concessions.\n\nYou play as Tsumaki Naoharu: an ambitious and curious young samurai working under Abe Masahiro, the chief senior councillor of Tokugawa Japan. From his lofty position, Abe must steer Japan‚Äôs response to this newfound threat. There are no playbooks to guide him, and your help will be crucial.\n\nYou will discover that residents of Edo are on edge, the opinions of the local lords are at odds with each other, and the current systems are on the brink of being upended. You will learn that no one can decide whether to open up to Western trade or keep Japan closed entirely‚ÄîAbe is no exception. You will contend with multiple factions each with their own plans for Japan.\n\nNaoharu is the second son of his own family. Unlike his older brother, Naoharu does not have the right to inherit the family estate and is already in debt. He must perform well in order to keep his position in the Tokugawa hierarchy and establish productive political connections for a secure, debt-free future.\n\nAs Naoharu, you will meet several factions whose ideologies and plans may intrigue, fascinate or puzzle him. It‚Äôs up to you, the player, to decide which ideas hold the most weight, which ideas Naoharu will follow, and what end he will meet. Beware, however, of the consequences. The choices you make matter.\n\nThere is no traditional sense of ‚Äúwinning‚Äù in Ghosts Over The Water; the primary goal of the game is to explore and navigate the nuances of Tokugawa Japan's response to the Americans. You will discover what Japan feared, what it dreamed of, and what destiny it pursued in the end. \n\nIn Ghosts Over the Water, the fate of Japan lies with you.\n\n[From [url=https://studiounagi.itch.io/ghosts]Itch.io[/url]]","aliases":["Ghosts over the Water: Changing the Tides of Japan's Future"],"title":"Ghosts Over The Water"},{"aliases":["Ê±üÊà∏Âüé„Åß„ÅÆÂàÉÂÇ∑"],"title":"Ako: A Test of Loyalty","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/25/58325.jpg"},"developers":[{"id":"p15134","name":"Epoch: History Games Initiative"}],"description":"Imagine you're a young samurai in Japan in 1701.

As you explore the city, you will meet friends who came from different parts of the world: the Ghana Empire, the Vardhana dynasty(northern India), and the Sogdian Empire(Iranians). Each woman has her own dream and aspirations. Serwa is a business owner and a shaman; she's passionate about math and science. Anahita loves dancing and singing. She also visits the fire temple. Prisha is a talented writer that focuses on the tales of marginalized groups of people. She can speak Old Turkic with ease. Build a life-long friendship with these phenomenal women. Meet them in the capital city to unlock their stories and understand the world they come from. \n\n\"I think women's friendship can blossom into something beautiful. In Tang culture, men's relationships and ties are seen as the most important and valuable.  And some people think only men are loyal, selfless, and self-sacrificing when it comes to their friends.  But I think women's friendship can also be fulfilling, trustworthy, and we can do so much for our sisters and friends.\"\n\nDemons in the game are the byproducts of myths, prejudice, and falsehood of your time. They are sometimes \"embodiments of less desirable cultural characteristics --- misogyny, racism, and classicism.\" As a sorceress, you must obliterate demons and reshape the rigid system. [1] As you remove stereotypes, close the gap between social classes, and make changes in your world, you will realize that people are not so different from each other despite of our racial, ethnic, cultural, and gender differences. As a human, extend love and appreciation to those who need them. And as a demon slayer, remove the symbols of hate and dismantle myths in your world. \n\n\"If all the rules that confine women are set by men of the past, then it is time for me to reinterpret those rules again to set women free. After all, myths can be fabricated, histories can be reinvented, and the system must also be reshapable. \"\n                                                                                                     \nSome characters have restricted ability powers. For instance, a sorcerer who believes in Daoism will be able to use fire-typed abilities when his allies are men, and water-typed abilities when he's fighting with women. But what happens when his allies are nonbinary? As the player, you need to guide your allies and take the role of a leader.\n\n[From [url=https://mayflowerstudiogames.itch.io/sorceress-and-demons]Itch.io[/url]]","developers":[{"id":"p15467","name":"Mayflower Studio Games"}],"id":"v38277"},{"id":"v38278","description":"It‚Äôs a gender-bent version of a popular Chinese mythology, the Seven Fairies.

The class president, Minami, is tasked with organizing the erotic objects and is interrupted by a classmate, Anri, who shows interest in the objects. Minami eventually collapses from exhaustion.\nThe next day, when she confronted some boys about their strange behavior, it turned out that they all had a video of Manami masturbating with an erotic toy from the day before. In the video, Manami smiles lasciviously and says, \"P-Please tell me how many times you came using this video tomorrow...\" Manami denies any involvement and claims that she has nothing to do with the video.\nAnri starts deleting a video from a boy's phone when another boy refuses and escapes, only to be swallowed up by darkness. The classroom panics and an erotic video appears on the TV, causing the teacher, Hinano, to remember a similar incident from her school days. She believes the class is cursed and that they must engage in sexual activities every day. Those who try to run away will be swallowed by darkness and confined in a space of humiliation.

There are few things millions of lightyears away that would even regard earth with little more than indifference.\n\nAll the way in New York, Evelyn Lima is your average 15 year old girl in high school, dealing with all of the usual trouble for someone her age: bullies, staying awake in school, trying to figure out her future, and what she'll do with her friends each afternoon. However, with a new year starting, she and her friends are about to have their lives irreversibly changed, and will have to figure out how to navigate their teenage years with incredible power and purpose bestowed to them.\n\nThe Bronx is the world she knows, with each and every place she goes to hang out with her friends, to pick up groceries, to simple walks to school all being familiar and safe.\n\nThe world, no, the universe is about to open up completely, and all of its mysteries and greater powers will be laid bare before her and her friends. Magical powers, mysterious enemies, and the terrifying realization that everything she thinks she knows will no longer be the same is fast approaching.\n\nEve's journey is just beginning.\n\nDaughters of the Stars is an episodic visual novel starring Eve Lima and her friends, set in New York in the mid-nineties and heavily inspired by the era.\n\n[From [url=https://sloanerisette.itch.io/dots-ep1-demo]Itch.io[/url]]","id":"v40308"},{"id":"v40309","description":null,"developers":[{"id":"p16285","name":"unpajaro"}],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/93/61993.jpg"},"title":"Un lobo en la ciudad","aliases":[]},{"id":"v40310","developers":[{"id":"p16286","name":"Motheous"}],"description":"In this short visual novel you follow Elfie on her way home, together with her best friend Abelone.\n\n[From [url=https://motheous.itch.io/elfie]Itch.io[/url]]","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/94/61994.jpg"},"title":"Elfie","aliases":[]},{"aliases":[],"title":"Grimin: A New Joke","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/95/61995.jpg"},"description":"Enter the world of Grimin, a place where instead of laughing, people need to eat to survive, but if you are happy for too long, you die.\n\nFollow Roger Thahtsur, an eager and hopeful young man who hopes to one day be a stand-up comedian in Murphy, the grandest city in Grimin.

Will the 'savior' who is trapped in the royal palace adorned with blessed roses bring salvation or ruin? \n\n[Translated & edited from [url=https://usurahi.net/raffileur/]official website[/url]]","developers":[{"id":"p12761","name":"USURAHI"}],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/25/63225.jpg"}},{"title":"Tobeta to Shite mo Buta wa x ne","aliases":[],"id":"v41357","description":null,"developers":[{"id":"p5190","name":"Matoko"}],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/27/63227.jpg"}},{"id":"v41358","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/29/63229.jpg"},"description":null,"developers":[{"id":"p5190","name":"Matoko"}],"aliases":[],"title":"Kirakibou!"},{"title":"V√óV Day!","aliases":[],"id":"v41359","description":null,"developers":[{"name":"Matoko","id":"p5190"}],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/30/63230.jpg"}},{"id":"v41360","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/31/63231.jpg"},"description":null,"developers":[{"name":"Tabi no Mama ni","id":"p16691"}],"aliases":[],"title":"Long Long Ago‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"},{"aliases":[],"title":"My Favorite Song ~Extra Stories~","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/32/63232.jpg"},"description":"A visual novel adaptation of the web novel \"My Favorite Song\" 's bonus episode.","developers":[{"id":"p16692","name":"Shinjou Kairi"}],"id":"v41361"},{"id":"v41362","description":null,"developers":[{"id":"p12829","name":"tato"}],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/33/63233.jpg"},"title":"Kemo no Kare","aliases":[]},{"title":"Kemono Road","aliases":[],"id":"v41363","description":null,"developers":[{"name":"tato","id":"p12829"}],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/53/63853.jpg"}},{"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/35/63235.jpg"},"description":null,"developers":[{"id":"p5190","name":"Matoko"}],"id":"v41364","aliases":[],"title":"Sanagi no Ai"},{"aliases":[],"title":"Move Meraruka!","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/36/63236.jpg"},"developers":[{"name":"Matoko","id":"p5190"}],"description":null,"id":"v41365"},{"aliases":[],"title":"MARRIAGE OF DEATH","id":"v41366","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/37/63237.jpg"},"developers":[{"name":"Matoko","id":"p5190"}],"description":null},{"aliases":[],"title":"RABBITMAIDEN~SOFTBOOK","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/38/63238.jpg"},"description":"RABBITMAIDEN~SOFTBOOK is a companion visual novel to the mainline rabbitmaiden softworks vns (e.g. heartlovepowertemple) ..\n\n[From [url=https://yogurt200.itch.io/rabbitmaidensoftbook]itch.io[/url]]","developers":[{"name":"RABBITMAIDENSOFTWORKS","id":"p13490"}],"id":"v41367"},{"id":"v41368","developers":[{"name":"RABBITMAIDENSOFTWORKS","id":"p13490"}],"description":"6 FAIRYMAIDENS wake up..an oasis mansion in deserted JUPITER..and missing memories of a previous life\n\ntogether they begin a group mission to remember & as the past is revealed, so is the future fate result..~ smile!\n\n[From [url=https://heavensmiles.neocities.org/]heavensmiles[/url]]","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/40/63240.jpg"},"title":"SPECIAL GIRLS STORY","aliases":[]},{"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/42/63242.jpg"},"developers":[{"name":"Kuma no Ko Dou","id":"p12758"}],"description":"A magician-in-training is tasked with decorating for a Halloween party.","id":"v41369","aliases":[],"title":"Halloween Kikiippatsu"},{"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/43/63243.jpg"},"developers":[{"id":"p16693","name":"Momoya Honpo"}],"description":"Once upon a time there was a beautiful kingdom surrounded by mountains called the Country of Garland.\nUntil now, the flower crown country had no exchanges with other countries, but two years ago, it began to accept travelers little by little.

And he had no idea what trials would fall to his lot when he decided to go to the Rassvet.\n\n[From [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2069920/]Steam[/url]]","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/62/63562.jpg"}},{"id":"v41647","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/84/64484.jpg"},"developers":[{"id":"p16826","name":"Grumpy Gordey"}],"description":null,"aliases":[],"title":"Nedelja otkrytij"},{"title":"------","aliases":[],"id":"v41649","developers":[{"name":"horrorfantasy","id":"p11082"}],"description":null,"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/65/63565.jpg"}},{"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/66/63566.jpg"},"developers":[{"name":"horrorfantasy","id":"p11082"}],"description":null,"id":"v41650","aliases":[],"title":"grayishblue"},{"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/22/87722.jpg"},"developers":[{"name":"Renio Studios","id":"p16828"}],"description":"The story is about a 24 year old woman, Lacey Williamson, a nurse working in a large hospital in the fictional town of Rockingham.
