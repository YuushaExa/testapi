It's not like he doesn't try to get out there, but there's one lady he can't get out of his head… His BOSS!? Who can blame him?\n\nArisa Shinoda is a 100% certified MILF (and a great manager to boot)! She's a single mother who roared back to the professional scene after she left her ex-husband in the dirt. Arisa is a professional woman who pushes people to do their best but keeps everyone in the office happy. She'll even pour everyone drinks at company parties! You could search Japan three times over and never find someone better than her, according to Daigo at least.\n\nOur tale of lust lewd behaviour starts at an office party. Everyone is drinking and having a good time, when Arisa pulls our man Daigo aside to let him know something came up and she has to leave early to return to the office, and tasks him with maintaining the party vibe.\n\nAfter everyone finishes their drinks and snacks, Daigo makes a quick trip back to the office to check if Arisa might need a hand. Instead of helping the boss burn the midnight oil filing a last minute TPS report, he finds her knuckles deep in an unexpected deed… She's masturbating?!\n\nThe sight before him is so glorious, his body is acting on instinct. Before he knows it, Daigo's pants are off and he has joined Arisa in this late-night masturbation session. As they both reach their respective climaxes, all the emotions he has swirling around inside overflow and he stands up from his vantage point. In their afterglows, they share a silent moment staring at each other in disbelief...\n\nSeeing Daigo standing before her, rock-hard like the stud he is, Arisa goes all in on a gamble to relieve her frustrations. Frustrations that were caused by her sister-in-arms, Shiori, fucking Arisa's own son!?

They might encounter a life of separation from each other. Some of them may meet again, while others may never see other again. Secrets that are covered by rapidly falling snow are interwoven with a sorrowful rhythm. Broken families, Experiences of bullying, Tears concealed by smiles. Is the taste of first love sweet or bitter? Who will be redeemed, and who will enter the abyss? Attracted, estranged, separated, hurt. Young men and women, three encounters, each carries sorrowful secrets in the cold winter. Embracing each other and absorbing the earth’s final, small bit of warmth.\n\nDuring the last winter before Shoba Senior Middle School entrance examinations, Shoba Senior Middle School welcomed a pretty transfer student named Moe Miyazawa. She was assigned to sit next to Hiro Fujiwara, and had a heavenly appearance as well as an unapproachable air. She looked like an ice-cold snowflake and indifferently floated into Hiro Fujiwara’s heart. It seemed like a romantic beginning. Moe Miyazawa looked pretty and had outstanding grades, but was very cold and detached. Her classmates did not welcome her, and did not develop close relationships with her. However, her talent and beauty touched Hiro Fujiwara, whose family had already been broken. Furthermore, she also seemed to regard Hiro Fujiwara as someone unique. He couldn’t help but feel moved by Moe Miyazawa, but it was just that when he tried to get close to her, he found that it was really too difficult to get close to this girl.\n\nAt the same time, Reika Fukihara, a charming girl with a warmhearted smile, also had a chance encounter with Hiro Fujiwara.\n\nShe was outgoing and magnanimous, had a warm personality, and was also a bit bizarre, which gave Hiro Fujiwara a feeling he had never previously experienced. Hiro Fujiwara was obviously attracted to Moe Miyazawa, while Reika Fukihara’s vitality and uninhibited personality as well as her enthusiasm may have caused other people to see her as stubborn and unyielding. However, Hiro Fujiwara thought that Reika Fukihara was just like an angel opening up her wings in front of him.

When he found this, he did his best in finding out what happened to his father, but no luck.\n\nA few days after the cops came to his door, Phill, the principal of the high school where Brian was a student, came to him and told him that he could live with him for a while. While living with Phill, Brian did plenty of bad stuff, but in the end things got better\n\nThe main purpose of the player will be to find out why is his father in prison, while his second goal will be to find out what everybody hides. Everybody has secrets, and your job is to find them. Some characters have big secrets, while other not so much.\n\n[Edited from [url=https://www.patreon.com/royalcandy]Patreon[/url]]","id":"v29015","title":"No More Secrets","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/88/43088.jpg"},"aliases":[]},{"title":"XXXover ~O Shiki ADV~","id":"v29016","description":null,"developers":[{"id":"p10803","name":"Akatsuki Akazadou"}],"aliases":[],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/89/43089.jpg"}},{"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/90/43090.jpg"},"aliases":[],"title":"Elysion2 -Genes of the Saints-","developers":[{"id":"p10813","name":"utp"}],"description":null,"id":"v29017"},{"title":"Budeliao de Youguidianche Nanti!","developers":[{"id":"p10815","name":"MxLucid"}],"description":null,"id":"v29018","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/93/43093.jpg"},"aliases":[]},{"aliases":[],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/70/80470.jpg"},"title":"Hillside","id":"v29019","description":"The exclusive district of Hillside is home to the country's film industry and to those lucky enough to be able to afford to live there.

As is the case with earlier games in the series, Blood: The Last Vampire features full voice-acting and plays non-stop as a regular TV anime with player choices which need to be selected in a time limit of only a couple of seconds and result in story branching or slight alteration of the events. The game has multiple endings and by re-playing it, more choices and ending get unlocked. There is a flowchart show the overall story progress and taken routes so replaying does not become repetitive.\n\nThe PSP release of Blood: The Last Vampire is a compilation of first (上巻) and last volume (下巻) which were released as two separate games for PlayStation 2. In addition the PSP release has doubled the CG gallery and also includes special movie edits for each of the three heroines which can be unlocked by completing the game.\n\nBased on the manga and anime movie with the same title, this game focuses on the story set in Tokyo a couple of decades after the original series. While the anime and game stories don't have direct connection, the game setting is based on the same world as in the original series. While Saya is the protagonist of the original story, this story features a young boy who is a high-school student, as the protagonist. One day, while riding a subway, he experiences the strangest sensation... he starts hearing a demonic voice that no one else can hear. This soon starts to affect his daily life and drive him towards madness, but then Saya, the last remaining original vampire enters his life.\n\nSource: Mobygames","developers":[{"id":"p1409","name":"Sony Interactive Entertainment"},{"id":"p3077","name":"Production I.G"},{"id":"p10173","name":"Will Co., Ltd."}],"id":"v29081","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/75/99275.jpg"},"aliases":["Yarudora Series Vol. 5: Blood: The Last Vampire","やるドラ ポータブル Blood the Last Vampire"]},{"aliases":[],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/89/86189.jpg"},"title":"Pleasure villa","id":"v29083","description":"During a difficult period of his life, young Tommy has finally found the perfect job!

No other species in existence can interact with metaphysical energies the way humans can.\n\nFor millennia, alien races have traveled to Earth in order to exploit this power.

Travel to and from the Sol system was heavily regulated, and Earth became the most locked-down planet in the universe.  On top of that, humans are advancing, and convincing them of the impossible has gotten tougher than ever.  This hasn't stopped the flow of fortune-seekers, who even today will give up everything to get a ticket to Earth, and a chance to get something no other race in the universe can provide.\n\nOne of those fortune-seekers is Farien Aanarhi, an Earth-jumper from the planet Phaelon.  Three years ago, Farien sold off his most prized possession to pay for his ticket to Earth, thinking he could easily convince humans to believe he was insanely wealthy.

The island was occupied by humans. One day, a strange-looking man appeared on it. He had no memory of his own past, except his name, Dulldeek, and the hatred to humans. Without knowing what this hatred was caused by, Dulldeek feels the rage of the Dark inside him. He decides to infiltrate the castle of Veevik, the humans' fortress, to satisfy his burning anger...\n\nD'ark is a very simple solo first-person dungeon crawler. As Dulldeek, the player navigates maze-like pseudo-3D dungeons (with auto-mapping), encountering randomly appearing enemies and fighting them in turn-based combat to gain experience points and level up. The magic system is very basic, the sole choice being \"attack spell\" or \"healing spell\", both of which consume magic points.

But though Amadeus might be terrified of it, Severin knows she is not above ruining her own happiness for some greater outcome no one else will ever see. Sometimes, Severin thinks it would've been easier if they'd both died with no feeling more complex than the tenderness of a waltz into a glowing river. But now, the fear of Amadeus leaving Severin makes her want to corner Amadeus until she speaks the truth and nothing but the truth. God knows she's lied enough, though Severin no longer knows what god she's even referring to, since she and Amadeus are the higher beings, now. But even so, Severin knows she's human.\n\nOn the other hand, Amadeus is playing a much more intricate game, one that, at times, she does not even know she is playing, or that she is playing against herself. Amadeus knows only how to play games with her silver tongue or her silver scalpel. She has been alone so long, she doesn't know what it's like to have someone on her side, and she's not sure she likes it. But that uncertainty is outweighed by the calm, simple, domestic delight she's never known before, that feeling of home, of someone to wake up beside, and someone to go to sleep beside, and someone to eat what she cooks. The simple knowledge that Severin will eat whatever Amadeus makes, that Amadeus now has an equal to share with all her Vietnamese culinary secrets, this makes her feel more like she's leaving a legacy than any tableau of murder she's made before. But inside her is this knowledge that her human mimicry has one fatal flaw: intimacy. And what she is beyond that mimicry, what she is beyond a deft hand in the kitchen and a skilled knife outside of it, it is the divine. Amadeus is divine, and she knows there is no divine that is not a monster.  \n\nThe core conflict of MOTHLILY is that Severin has a human heart while Amadeus has a divine and monstrous one. They both knew that they'd die for each other, but now that they are alive, and they are more than godlike, they are gods—they have to learn what it means to be together, and how to stay together.\n\n[From [url=https://feyxuan.itch.io/mothlily-demo]itch.io[/url]]","id":"v29728","title":"MOTHLILY"},{"id":"v29729","description":"After his brother's disappearance, Curtis is approached by a strange man who pretends to know Cobra.

You ARE a writer, but the \"hometown\" is a play you wrote long ago and the \"mean old world\".... well, no, that's the mean old world. That's not a stand-in for anything.\n\nAs Joe Papp's author, you find yourself with the ability to change the story that you are in, making choices between multiple characters that ultimately dictate how the story progresses. Will you save the theater festival, or will you cause the zombie apocalypse?\n\n[From [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/947080/]Steam[/url]]","aliases":[],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/72/78972.jpg"}},{"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/43/83343.jpg"},"aliases":["Baby-making Life Starts After I Picked Up a Lonely Cat Girl"],"developers":[{"id":"p314","name":"Norn"}],"description":"One day, the protagonist finds a cat girl on the street, and decides to adopt her.\nIt seems she was driven out of her youkai home in the forest, and got lost in the human town.\nThe protagonist decides to have her live with him, and she pays him back with sex.\nSuch was the start of their lovey life.\n[From [url=https://www.dlsite.com/ecchi-eng/work/=/product_id/RE304661.html]DLsite English[/url]]","id":"v29806","title":"Kodoku na Neko Shoujo o Hirotte Hajimaru, Iyashi no Kozukuri Seikatsu"},{"description":"Akiyama Momoka is an ordinary girl who lives on a small, rabbit-filled island called Omorishima with her parents and her bratty little sister, Mikan.

If I have to describe our relationship I would say that: if she's the throttle, then I'm the brakes...(Okay bad analogy, but still I think that'd describe our relationship pretty well). You can't win a race just with speed, you need to push the brakes at the curves... and that's why we are a perfect match for each other! (at least I like to think so).\n\nIf you wonder how in the world we end up together, then the only answer I could come up with is destiny...(or maybe that we are childhood friends).\n\nAnyway, we haven't had much time to meet each other lately, due to university assignments, club activities, part-time job (for me), and other stuff.

Though you had a life, dreams, and aspirations once, it all got swept away once you were diagnosed with incurable late-stage brain cancer; now you're stuck in a hospital, living the last few weeks of your life in existential agony, incapable of processing what you did wrong to deserve this fate.\n\nEverything changes when, one day, you're approached by a scientist from the world's largest mega-corporation, who offers you a chance to escape your dying body and have your mind transplanted onto an android synth vessel; the only catch being, nobody knows whether the process works or not, whether you'll survive the transition or ultimately perish. With little holding you back, you eventually accept...\n\n...You awaken in your new body, feeling quite different from how you were before. Nobody can tell whether it's truly you inside the machine, or an AI pretending, believing that it's you. Not even you can tell. In a world where technology's constantly evolving, advanced AIs are viewed with fear and suspicion and few things are certain, you have to rebuild your old life from scratch, convince those who abandoned you on your deathbed that you're still here, and ultimately figure out whether you truly are who you claim to be.\n\n[From [URL=https://sedgelord.itch.io/nomorefuture]itch.io[/URL]]","developers":[{"name":"Sedge","id":"p11850"}],"id":"v30982"},{"developers":[{"id":"p11851","name":"Narcissos"}],"description":"In the distant future, humanity has learned how to upload memories onto physical VHS tapes called MemROM to usher in an era of digital immortality.

Owing to his father's seedy reputation and his own meek, socially awkward mannerisms, Marcel is bullied relentlessly by the other boys at his Parisian school, who seem determined to make his life miserable.\n\nAt the beginning of autumn in 1896, Marcel's brigand of a father becomes embroiled in a particularly salacious scandal, which is widely circulated in tabloids across Paris and beyond.\n\nFearful for her son's welfare, and desperate for him to have a respite from their family's continued drama, Marcel's long-suffering mother pulls Marcel from his school, and instead chooses to send him to her older sister's school in Myennes, deep in the French countryside. There is a catch in this seemingly innocuous plan, however. Marcel's formidable aunt, Albertine, owns an all-girls' establishment, which has never before admitted any male students. To attend his aunt's school, Marcel is bidden to dress and act like a girl – which he does, albeit, begrudgingly.\n\nMarcel never much fit in with his male classmates at his Parisian school, but he's similarly fearful that his female classmates in Myenes will also shun him. Uneasy and afraid, Marcel expects only the worst when he arrives at his aunt's school...\n\nWhich is why he finds it so very surprising when, rather than being treated with scorn, his new classmates instead seem rather fond of him.\n\nDuring his stay in the countryside, Marcel meets four girls who express an interest in him: the quiet, inscrutable Luce; the fiery troublemaker, Claudine; the elegant pianist, Celine; and the class dunce, Mirabel.\n\nAs the autumn months pass, Marcel grows closer to these four girls – but which one will he develop the strongest bond with?

Soon, these abilities or characteristics became known as \"Special Powers\", and those who possessed them as \"Special Holders\". Humanity sympathized with the early \"Special Holders\", but as their numbers expanded, their abilities started to be feared and avoided, and attempts to expel them from society arose. \"Special Holders\" also began to use their abilities against humanity. Some to defend themselves, while others to show off their abilities. Uprisings, crimes, and other similar events were commonplace as a result of this vicious cycle, and the battle between the two sides was escalating all over the world.\n\nLikewise, Japan too was not an exception, as there was an outbreak of conflicts between humen and \"Special Holders\". During that period of unrest, all the time there were grievous events like the government being temporarily suspended to fulfill some of its functions or a failed coup d'état attempt in a Japanese Self-Defense Forces academy. Japanese government took steps to address the country's unstable situation. It has formed a Special Riot Police force that includes both humans and \"Special Holders\". The chief of its second division, Kashiwabi Ayato, and his subordinates worked hard to maintain a public security. A few years after the establishment of the Special Riot Police, crime rates fell and public order was restored as a result of its members' efforts. Every day, Special Riot Police officers in Japan, which had briefly returned to calm, fought hard to keep Special Powers crimes under control.\n\nFollowing a certain case, the number of organized crimes perpetrated by Special Holders began to climb. Public unrest, government critics, and similar issues were rapidly spreading in proportion. All members of the Special Riot Police were called to investigate the case, each with their own set of suspicions. Before long, they were swallowed into a great conspiracy encompassing the whole country. The Army, which is taking actions to suppress the newly erupted conflict between humans and Special Holders with military power, and the protagonist with Special Riot Police, which is making efforts to settle the disturbance.

For other women, such a folly mightn’t have been so lethal, but for Yuel’s ill-fated mother – the wife and queen of Indra’s tyrannical king, Khalil – it spelt her doom.\n\nAs he witnesses his mother’s corpse decomposing beneath the intense sunlight, Yuel’s father offers him some sage words of wisdom: namely, not to trust women. They are, in Khalil’s words, wicked and deceitful, and becoming too attached can end in nothing save disaster.\n\nOutwardly, Yuel must swallow his sorrow, for fear of earning his father’s ire. Kings are not, after all, supposed to cry; even future kings such as him. In private, however, Yuel turns to his nursemaid, the kindly Safiya, for succour. Safiya is Yuel’s only ally in the palace: his father cold and distant; the servants deferential, brow-beaten, and kept silent through fear. Without Safiya, Yuel would be all alone...\n\nYet she, too, abandons him, when Yuel grows old enough to no longer need a nursemaid to tend to him.\n\nBereft and embittered, Yuel has nothing to look forward to, until – after a prolonged illness – his father eventually dies, and Yuel inherits the throne and the crown in his stead.\n\nNo longer a young boy – Safiya’s ‘little prince’ – but a grown man, Yuel plots to win Safiya over once more.
