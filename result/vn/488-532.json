This interpretation of the Ancient Greek drama has a fairly obvious distinct feature: it takes the form of a visual novel.\n\nThere are three tragedies included: Oedipus the King (also known as Oedipus Rex), Oedipus at Colonus and Antigone.\n\nThe Theban plays deal with the story of Oedipus and his family, but it is important to understand that they don't comprise a formal trilogy. Originally they were written over the course of almost four decades. Oedipus at Colonus is one of the last plays of Sophocles and it was staged after his death. And the earliest play here is actually Antigone.\n\nAll of the characters in the game are represented as marble sculptures. Usually quite damaged sculptures. The sole developer of the Oedipus/Antigone project is perfectly aware of the fact that ancient statues were painted. And that actors in ancient theaters wore masks. The choice of this particular style was absolutely conscious and one of the main ideas was to evoke a certain feeling. This is pretty much how objects of material culture from classical antiquity came down to us. This is how we frequently perceive classical antiquity.

Karellen decides everything from academic and professional careers, romantic interests, to one's daily meals.\n\nThe protagonist, Giovanni, has the lowest human score among the entire human race. Every day, he receives \"special treatment\" for everything including his meals and classes. On top of that, he gets bullied relentlessly by his classmates at the School, both in real life and online.\n\nBut one day, everything and everyone in the school starts attacking Giovanni, trying to \"remake\" him and raise his human score by making him \"more human\". A senior student, the famously eccentric genius Campanella, reaches out to Giovanni, and they hop onto (and take over) a driverless train on the galactic railroad. And so, Giovanni gets swept up in a journey to find the \"Crimson Southern Cross\", located at the farthest edge of the universe.\n\nOn their journey, the boys will meet great leaders of the past and pull reckless and destructive \"pranks\" on them all. Through their encounters with the history, twisted mysteries, and various horrors of the world, they will eventually have to confront the end of their own childhood.\n\nOh, did you hear that?

A new material, developed by a group of scientists, possesses not only extraordinary strength, hyper-elasticity, and energy-saving properties, but also a unique, or rather exceptional, ability to self-repair. This capability turned the material into a regenerative pill, allowing people with limited abilities to become fully functional humans, while also making them stronger, smarter, and even extending their lifespan. \n\nHowever, fearing the consequences of such power, the scientists decide to destroy the records, reports, and everything related to their research. They scattered, each going their own way. But as is often the case, someone found the remnants of this work. Ignoring the dangers, they decided to complete it, which eventually led to the formation of a globally banned terrorist organization called \"Masquerade.\" In response, leaders of major corporations launched a large-scale operation to eliminate the individual responsible and eradicate everything related to the research. \n\nYou are a former soldier, unable to bear the guilt of the atrocities committed during the operation. You retreat to a remote location on the edge of the world, a small town cut off from the rest of civilization, where you planned to live a peaceful life with your wife and children, far removed from all the troubles of the past. \n\nBut, as often happens, things do not go according to plan. One day, when your wife goes on a business trip to a certain research institute, she suddenly stops contacting you. In an attempt to find out what happened, you embark on a journey. Days, weeks, months, and years pass... Eventually, you come to terms with the fact that you may never see your wife again, burying all your emotions deep inside. Then, one day, your son arrives, asking for your help and with a glimmer of hope that not all is lost, that there is still a small chance to restore your peaceful life.\n\n[From [url=https://noglory.itch.io/astreon]Itch.io[/url]]","id":"v52777"},{"id":"v52778","aliases":[],"developers":[{"name":"Frontwing","id":"p336"},{"name":"Good Smile Company, Inc.","id":"p22807"}],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/36/93636.jpg"},"title":"KANADE","description":"In the near future, a sudden and unexplained proliferation of plants has left much of human civilization drowning in greenery.\nYuuto is a boy living in a once-thriving city that's now largely reclaimed by nature.\nOne day, a girl named Kanade appears on his doorstep.\nThe two had been exchanging letters after Kanade found one of Yuuto's carrier pigeons injured and nursed it back to health.\nKanade then reveals her biggest secrets, too important to write in a letter:\nThe fact that she's half alien, half human, and that she's on a mission to save the world with her song.\nShe sings before the bewildered Yuuto, demonstrating her power to pacify the plants.\n\n\"I have to sing the greatest love song and save the world in my mother's place.\nYuuto-san, would you please fall in love with me?\"\n\nAfter the disappearance of her mother,\nKanade was left clueless as to how to save the world, or why she had to fall in love in order to do so.\nEverything seemed shrouded in mystery.\nStill, Kanade's earnest wish stirs something within Yuuto,\nwho is always ready to lend a helping hand to those in need, and he decides to take a chance on her.\nWarmly watched over by those around them, the two tentatively begin their exploration of love.\nWhat neither of them realize is that a spark of affection has already budded between them...\n\nThis is the tale of a wondrous future where the encounter between a boy and girl brings a miracle to the world.\n\n[From [url=https://kanade.frontwing.co.jp/en/]official website[/url]]"},{"developers":[{"name":"Tily","id":"p18098"}],"aliases":["anokimi"],"title":"Ano Hi no Kimi o Furimukasete.","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/37/93637.jpg"},"description":"One day, the protagonist, Naomichi, realizes that he’s time-leaping.\nHe doesn’t know why, but this must be a chance given to him by God!\nHe remembers his many failures and the girl he likes, Yuu.\nIf he corrects his mistakes one by one, maybe he’ll be able to “fall in love” with her!?\nThinking this, Naomichi begins to revise his future little by little.\n– However, he always ends up returning to the same day after about a month.","id":"v52779"},{"image":null,"title":"COCORO","developers":[{"name":"Frontwing","id":"p336"},{"id":"p22807","name":"Good Smile Company, Inc."}],"aliases":[],"description":null,"id":"v52780"},{"id":"v52781","developers":[{"name":"Hasalynx Games","id":"p11743"}],"aliases":[],"image":null,"title":"Magical Mooncakes","description":null},{"title":"Rasen Gensou","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/65/93665.jpg"},"aliases":["Twisted Illusion"],"developers":[{"name":"Neko no Kessha","id":"p9987"}],"description":null,"id":"v52782"},{"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/66/93666.jpg"},"title":"Aoi no Shinen","developers":[{"id":"p9987","name":"Neko no Kessha"}],"aliases":["The Blue Abyss"],"description":null,"id":"v52783"},{"description":"You wake up in a strange circus.

You're not sure when your attraction to other boys started, but you knew it wasn't normal, or rather, society taught you it wasn't. After years of turmoil, you decide the time to come out is now! Having recently turned 18, you spent a few days plotting out how to do it, what to say, and how to react to any response you may get. However, after coming out to a certain someone, your life takes a turn you couldn't have possibly planned for, and now, your journey to become the femboy you've always wanted to be begins.\n\n[From [url=https://darkfate.itch.io/the-awakening-femboy-saga]Itch.io[/url]]","title":"The Awakening - Femboy Saga","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/20/93820.jpg"},"developers":[{"name":"DarkFate","id":"p22823"}],"aliases":[]},{"id":"v52808","developers":[],"aliases":["Thank You for Your Time: A Visual Novella"],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/29/93829.jpg"},"title":"Thank You for Your Time","description":"\"The outside world is a cold, harsh place. That's why you came here. The cavern provides you with a minimum of shelter and  - more importantly - the hope that you will one day be chosen to receive a place by the enormous fire hidden away in the dark depths below.\n\nTo be chosen, you will have to impress the inscrutable hooded figures that rule this place, but that is much easier said than done. Nobody has ever seen the Hoods react to an audition before - positively or negatively, or at all, and their Shadow servants never give anything away either.\n\nAnd yet, there's always a chance. So long as you can outwait your competition.\n\n\n\nThank You for Your Time is a visual novella that I made with Ren’Py as a solo dev. It’s a surreal parable about audition purgatory, and about a difficult question: how long will you wait for your once-in-a-lifetime opportunity? \n\nThe player will have to decide the answer that's right for themselves. I hope this game will be cathartic for anyone who has had to go for an audition or a job interview, or who has just felt stuck - so, most people. \n\nPlay duration is about 40 minutes to an hour. The game features a final choice that leads to two different endings, as well as a few smaller choices along the way that also impact the story.\n\nAll of the images in this game are AI generated. The story and narrative design are my own. This is a passion project that cost me nothing to create.

Memories of them indulging in the heavenly choir echo throughout their body. Yet, they find themselves living with invisible wings, and their feet stuck to the ground of the earth where humans reign. Vehuia knew that at some point they had been cast away, much like the fallen morning star of mythology. They no longer remembered why. They simply had to accept that they would continue living as they are.\n\nBanished from the heavenly realm, yet unable to connect with any of the flesh of the earth, Vehuia passed their days living in a cemetery. Often hearing the cries and prayers of the desperate. None of this piety is ever directed to them, but rather towards a strange statue of the Archangel Michael found within the cemetery's grounds. Even though every cry they hear is different, the one similarity Vehuia always notices is that each prayer is a request for one thing: exorcising demons.\n\nVehuia knew it was arrogant of them, but they felt the need to make use of the body they had to exorcise demons on the statue's behalf. They didn't expect to receive praise from the archangel. Nor from any of the humans. They simply had to continue living, and exorcisms paid just enough to support their vagabond life.\n\nHowever, though as effective as they were, they never saw themselves as a true exorcist. It wasn't a matter of pride or honor. They just never had any faith. They couldn't. Not as an angel with invisible wings. Not on this earth.\n\nBut one day...the statue of the archangel received a peculiar guest, a nun with scarlet eyes,  and request that was much unlike any Vehuia has ever undertaken...\n\nA great demon was being invited. Sacrifices were made. The blood of witchcraft's familiars, black cats and toads, was spilled. All within the barriers of a holy monastery.\n\nEven though it should have been impossible. Even though it was absurd.\n\nSimply hearing the nun's plea was enough to cast a shadow over Vehuia that made them wonder if this case...would make their invisible wings finally come to light.\n\n[From [url=https://venux-crucifix.itch.io/exalting-to-the-ephemeral-eden]Itch.io[/url]]"},{"developers":[{"name":"Just Producing Digital Entertainment","id":"p15561"}],"aliases":[],"title":"BABELOMANIA","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/20/94120.jpg"},"description":"20XX, 14th of May.

And through it all, she may be the only one with the knowledge to stop them. \n\n[From [url=https://flappyjack.itch.io/mothers]itch.io[/url]]","aliases":[],"developers":[{"name":"FlappyJack","id":"p22939"}],"title":"Mothers","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/85/94985.jpg"}},{"id":"v53074","aliases":[],"developers":[{"id":"p11653","name":"Mushroomallow"}],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/01/104101.jpg"},"title":"Death & Faeology","description":"You are a renowned faeologist in 1920s New York who has been tasked with solving a chilling crime:\nBizarre murders happening across the upper echelons of New York society, with the mystery deepening with every clue.\n\nFollow the clues with your fae expertise and keen investigative tools such as a magnifying glass and a blacklight, and gather vital information by interviewing those who hold fragments of the truth, all while navigating your allegiance between a relentless detective and your enigmatic patron.\n\nWill you unravel the truth and cement the importance of faeology in a world that relegates it to the realm of pseudoscience?\n\n[From [url=https://mushroomallow.itch.io/dark-and-faeology-prologue]itch.io[/url]]"},{"title":"Yoake o Matsu, Hoshitachi e.","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/96/94996.jpg"},"aliases":[],"developers":[{"name":"Fujikino","id":"p11969"}],"description":null,"id":"v53075"},{"id":"v53076","image":null,"title":"Chakotto Game Kenkyuukai ~Suzume Taichou no Maid Cafe~","developers":[{"id":"p43","name":"Conteride Co., Ltd."}],"aliases":["チャコゲー"],"description":null},{"title":"Star Majesty - Kagayakeru Hoshiboshi ni Erabareta Futago no Utahime -","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/31/95031.jpg"},"aliases":[],"developers":[],"description":"Kotone Rina, a girl who loves singing, enrolls in the sky magic school Lyceum with her twin sister Kotone Runa.\nTo make her dream come true, she and her sister become the first twin divas chosen by the shining stars in history.\n\nTranslated from the booth.pm page","id":"v53077"},{"description":null,"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/32/95032.jpg"},"title":"Funeral Summer","aliases":[],"developers":[{"id":"p1738","name":"*coelacanth*"}],"id":"v53078"},{"developers":[{"name":"*coelacanth*","id":"p1738"}],"aliases":[],"title":"25-Toki no Uroborosu","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/34/95034.jpg"},"description":null,"id":"v53079"},{"id":"v53080","title":"OgamiyaZIN","image":null,"developers":[{"name":"Team Nagikaze","id":"p9932"}],"aliases":[],"description":null},{"description":null,"title":"Futari de Kan'oke e","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/35/95035.jpg"},"aliases":[],"developers":[{"name":"*coelacanth*","id":"p1738"}],"id":"v53081"},{"id":"v53082","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/37/95037.jpg"},"title":"Seirenkeppaku Junketsu Jigoku","aliases":[],"developers":[{"id":"p1738","name":"*coelacanth*"}],"description":null},{"id":"v53083","description":null,"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/48/95048.jpg"},"title":"Line*geII I LOVE DE NEESAN-vol.2-","aliases":[],"developers":[{"name":"OSO","id":"p22942"}]},{"id":"v53084","aliases":[],"developers":[{"name":"Yaoyorozu-Kobo","id":"p1376"}],"title":"Maid/stay night","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/46/95146.jpg"},"description":null},{"title":"Cries of the Carcass Eater","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/56/95156.jpg"},"aliases":[],"developers":[{"name":"DOMINO CLUB","id":"p16618"}],"description":null,"id":"v53085"},{"title":"The Scaly Valley","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/58/95158.jpg"},"aliases":[],"developers":[],"description":"The Scaly Valley is a 18+ visual novel set in a classic fantasy world that blends magic and dragons with lewd stories.\n\nBuild deep and soft relationships with your companions.

While he may have appeared to be a good king, many who worked directly under him knew the truth: that he sought greater power than that allowed for him by the crown. He wanted more than the kingdom had to offer, and feverishly so. Many chose to follow him out of fear; after all, they could not be killed if they were useful to him.\n\nOne member of his court stood out, however, and it was not because of his ridiculous choice of clothes or his love of pranks. His name was Ozymandias, and he was the court jester. He was perhaps the king's most trusted court official, and the king would show his love for Ozymandias every day with the finest gifts, foods, and plenty of leniency when his pranks went too far. Ozymandias, however, did not find the same fondness with the king. Ozymandias was a practicing wizard, always searching for all the magic he could possibly learn, and he hoped that one day, he would be able to use his magic to help others, starting with the overthrowing of the king.\n\nOne day, the king discovered a way to live forever with more power than anyone could possibly imagine. The first step was to become a lich. The king entrusted Ozymandias to gather the supplies and help him obtain his goal. Ozymandias did so more than willingly, and prepared for the ritual.\n\nWhen everything was set, he turned to Ozymandias and thanked him for his help. As the last words fell from his lips, Ozymandias thrust a dagger into the stomach of the king and bled him over the phylactery.

On his way home, a luxurious limousine suddenly stops in front of him, and an unknown beautiful woman accompanied by men in black suits appears and says:\n\nWoman: \"I have come to pick you up, 'Seedbearer'.\"\n\nThe women forcefully take the bewildered protagonist to a certain mansion.\nThe beautiful woman, \"Kousaka Iyo,\" reveals a shocking truth to the confused protagonist. This place is the private residence of the famous company \"Tenkuin Shoji\"'s president, and that president, \"Yoichiro Tenkuin,\" is the protagonist's real father. His mother was once a maid in the Tenkuin household, got pregnant by Yoichiro, and was ordered to abort to avoid future troubles, but she refused and disappeared from the mansion. Thus, the protagonist was born. He was astounded as he had never been told about his father.\nMoreover, the reason for bringing him here is explained. Successors to the president have met with misfortune one after another, leaving no one to carry on the family blood. Yoichiro, being elderly, can no longer have new heirs.\nTherefore, they have chosen the protagonist, even though he is an illegitimate child, as he shares the same blood.\n\nProtagonist: \"So, you want me to become the successor...?\"\nIyo: \"No, not at all. Our company's AI, 'Demeter (Goddess of Fertility),' predicts that if you become the successor, the group would collapse in no time.\"\nProtagonist: \"Huh...!? Then what should I do?\"\nIyo: \"We want you to produce an heir.\"\n\nIn this mansion, there are maids prepared for the protagonist, and they are to bear his children to create an heir. Each maid has her own compelling circumstances and is strictly ordered to comply with the protagonist's commands.\n\nIyo: \"If you have children with them, an excellent heir will be born, and the group will prosper even more... according to Demeter's predictions.\"\nIyo: \"I recommend you follow the predictions and embrace them.\"\n\nWhile being treated like a stud isn't something he likes, with the opportunity to do whatever he wants with beautiful women... there's no reason to let this chance go to waste.\nThus, the protagonist, who had lived in the shadows until now, fully utilizes his accidentally acquired position to enjoy a deprived life of impregnating sex with the maids.\n\nTranslated from https://www.guilty-soft.com/product/harameido/#story","id":"v53713"},{"developers":[{"name":"Haetae","id":"p23267"}],"aliases":["Spirits in Mountain"],"title":"Sanjunghogeol","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/08/99808.jpg"},"description":"This is a visual novel about an ordinary college student who meets furries, characters rooted in traditional Korean culture, and experiences the events that unfold.

Your dad and stepmom had been divorced for years, and you've never been close with your half sister, Paige.\n\nFortunately, you get to do this alone, at your own pace. \n\nAs you start the process though, that same feeling from your childhood is still there. But there's more... a presence, maybe? It shifts from terrifying to comforting. And it all seems to circle around the basement that your dad never let you enter.\n\nYou need to find out what's down there. You need to understand what is in the house with you. And you need to open this lockbox that your dad left behind.\n\n[From [url=https://beepsalt.itch.io/in-the-foundations]itch.io[/url]]","id":"v54389"},{"id":"v54390","description":"Psychological comedy BL visual novel in which the murderer shows up to meet the other 4 characters","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/12/102212.jpg"},"title":"Yonin no Hanayome","aliases":[],"developers":[{"id":"p18496","name":"Ayama Team"}]},{"id":"v54391","description":null,"title":"Tomare Miyou","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/13/102213.jpg"},"developers":[{"name":"Ayama Team","id":"p18496"}],"aliases":[]},{"id":"v54392","title":"Dousei Program","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/27/102227.jpg"},"developers":[{"name":"Oppai Guild","id":"p3742"}],"aliases":[],"description":null},{"id":"v54393","description":null,"aliases":[],"developers":[{"name":"Lamb no Oheya","id":"p23574"}],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/33/102233.jpg"},"title":"Chijo Chitai ~Ore no Hikkoshi Saki ga Mazo Ochi Kakujitsu no Kiken Chitai Datta Kudan~"},{"id":"v54394","title":"M2 ~My lover and the cute Death~","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/34/102234.jpg"},"developers":[{"name":"Hazuki Laboratory","id":"p23575"}],"aliases":[],"description":null},{"developers":[{"name":"Hazuki Laboratory","id":"p23575"}],"aliases":[],"title":"Lumia no Sainanna Ichinichi","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/35/102235.jpg"},"description":null,"id":"v54395"},{"developers":[{"name":"Gajumaru","id":"p22122"}],"aliases":[],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/36/102236.jpg"},"title":"Oshikake Gemini","description":null,"id":"v54396"},{"description":null,"title":"DQ III -Kesenai Bouken no Sho-","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/38/102238.jpg"},"aliases":["○Q3-消せない冒険の書-"],"developers":[{"id":"p3058","name":"Torara Studio"}],"id":"v54397"},{"description":null,"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/41/102241.jpg"},"title":"Konbini Baito to Stalker","aliases":[],"developers":[{"id":"p6118","name":"Gracias"}],"id":"v54398"},{"id":"v54399","developers":[{"name":"Fiction Factory Games","id":"p6841"}],"aliases":[],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/44/102244.jpg"},"title":"The Shadow Over Cyberspace","description":"Dread whispers echo across the Information Superhighway.

He had a cold hatred for his father, and a dark and twisted love for his young, beautiful and attractive mother.\n\n He may be like that, but in reality, he didn't live a life that would make his parents feel pessimistic. After all, he hasn't actually been bullied, and for several years now he has been day trading, giving up his school time, and has acquired a huge amount of assets. He has good relationships with his friends, and is able to obtain most of the things that money can buy. But now, he has given up, saying, \"No matter how much money you have, it doesn't necessarily mean you'll be happy.'' \n\nWhat he really wants is not money, but Mizuki, a mother and a woman. One day, he notices that Mizuki, who usually acts cheerfully, is looking haggard. Mizuki says there is something she would like to discuss with Yoshio, but Yoshio says,  \"The company's project is reaching its climax and I am busy,'' and her son is unable to approach her. Late at night, using Mizuki's finger, who is asleep from crying, he breaks through the smartphone's fingerprint authentication and registers his own fingerprint.\n \nThe next day, while Mizuki was taking a bath, he checked her smartphone and learned from her email and SNS history that his beloved mother had fallen victim to an investment scam and owes millions of yen. Furthermore, he learns that the reason she fell for the scam was because she tried to give her husband a luxury watch, which is his only hobby.\n\n Yoshio was in charge of all his own income and only gave Mizuki the amount of living expenses for his needs, so as a housewife, she didn't have any free money. As he explodes with hatred towards his father, and her husband, he realizes that his love for his mother, Mizuki, is becoming even more distorted....\n\nWith his financial strength, it would be a no-brainer for him to shoulder Mizuki's debt. Driven by passionate feelings, he comes up with a plan and pretends to be a fictitious wealthy man, \"X'', and sends a threatening email to Mizuki saying, \"I am a pervert who gets excited by watching a real parent and child having sex. If you send me a video of you having sex with your son, I will take over the debt depending on the content. If you report it to the police, I will reveal the debt to your husband.''\n\nHe then deposited a percentage of the debt into Mizuki's bank account as a deposit. He feels a dark sense of joy as he sees Mizuki clearly upset the next day. Then comes the night of the video trade deadline. Mizuki stealthily sneaks into his room, holding her breath as his chest and cock almost burst with excitement. Those fingers gently touch his rising desire...\n\n[Translated from the [url=https://www.orcsoft.jp/dwf016/story.html]official site[/url]]"},{"id":"v54750","description":"Visual novel featuring VTuber Amau Syrup","aliases":[],"developers":[{"name":"Rabbitfoot","id":"p18129"}],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/57/103457.jpg"},"title":"Yumeutsutsu Syrup -Dreamy Syrup-"},{"id":"v54751","title":"S-tte Eirin Gyouretsu no Dekiru Shinryoujo","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/10/103410.jpg"},"developers":[{"id":"p1144","name":"Kasugachou"}],"aliases":[],"description":null},{"id":"v54752","developers":[{"name":"Crystal Door Studios","id":"p23765"}],"aliases":[],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/12/103412.jpg"},"title":"Call to Passion","description":"You're just an average gamer, spending most of your time avoiding people and glued to your screen.

He invested his small savings in renting a modest apartment in an old, somewhat dilapidated neighborhood of the city. Max was looking forward to freedom, silence and the opportunity to manage his own life, not realizing that his new home was shrouded in a dark secret.\n\nHis journey to the nearest grocery store was marred by an unexpected encounter. Anatoly, nicknamed Tolik, a former classmate with whom Maxim had had a difficult, even hostile relationship since high school, came out to meet him. Tolik, who had visibly grown up and had acquired the appearance of a local hooligan, brazenly declared that the neighborhood was under his “protection” and demanded money from Maxim, ostensibly for a “roof”, explicitly hinting at possible problems in case of refusal. The unpleasant incident spoiled Maxim's mood and gave him a bad feeling.\n\nBack in the apartment, Max began to notice strange things. At night his sleep was disturbed by unexplainable rustles and creaks, icy draughts walked around the apartment, although all the windows were closed. The old photographs on the walls, left by the previous tenants, seemed alive to Maxim, as if watching his every move. Once he clearly felt someone's presence nearby, although he was absolutely sure that he was alone in the apartment. The atmosphere thickened, became heavy and ominous.\n\nMystical events made Maxim nervous and looking for explanations for what was happening. He began to look into the past of his new dwelling, trying to find answers to the questions that arose. The mystery of the apartment became a real test for him, forcing him to face not only the inexplicable, but also his own past.\n\n[From [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/3495820/]Steam[/url]]","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/82/104582.jpg"},"title":"KVARTIRANT","developers":[{"id":"p22453","name":"STuNT"},{"id":"p23881","name":"Reanim Games"}],"aliases":[]},{"id":"v55048","description":null,"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/83/104583.jpg"},"title":"Saikyouai Fetishism","developers":[{"name":"paraphy","id":"p23882"}],"aliases":[]},{"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/88/104588.jpg"},"title":"Inaka de Kawaii Oyome-san to","developers":[{"name":"BABEL","id":"p1247"}],"aliases":[],"description":null,"id":"v55049"},{"id":"v55050","description":"The Journey That Will Kill You.
