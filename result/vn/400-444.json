In parallel, a human group got together on Earth and the colour crimson was used to identify individuals in the Crimson Circle. Over the years, the collective consciousness of this group has become an entity of its own and may be perceived as a crimson dragon named Shaumbra!\n\nLuzi works with two students to discover true historical events and meet this crimson dragon. It turns out that Shaumbra has quite a personality and, together with the white dragon, Loong, the Elven woman, Josela, Quan Yen, Gaya, Merlin, Nikola Tesla, Saint Germain and others, they gain information from the past and future. What they find is not commonly accepted, but it fits with hidden and not-so-hidden knowledge dismissed by established society. Luzi’s unborn daughter brings light into everyone’s hearts and plays a major role in balancing a broken family.

This connection is initially established with a consciousness that appears as the human concept of the Unicorn. The horn is not really a horn, but a swirl of energy or, more precisely, a point of consciousness for communication to consciousness and energy. This point is widely misunderstood to be the third eye, as people imagine it to connect to the visual cortex for creating images. \n\nWhen Luzi visits the twenty-two crystal caves, she encounters the new energy that may benefit the one who has the consciousness to tap into it.\n\nLuzi’s perspective is the artificial intelligence, AI, robotics and augmentation and evolution of the human body, and how humanity will live with these things. Her daughter, Julia, focuses on the human coalition with the planet and the imbalance between the feminine and the masculine.\n\nDivine wisdom is given through the unicorn, Alea, the white dragon, Loong, the crimson dragon, Shaumbra, Gaia, Pan, Kuthumi, Saint Germain, Sekhmet and others. Luzi will connect to her own divine wisdom as she continues on her journey for embodied realisation, also called enlightenment.\n\n[From [url=https://eriqa-queen.itch.io/return-of-the-unicorn]Itch.io[/url]]","id":"v41849"},{"id":"v41850","description":"Based on book 4 of 5 in the Luzi Cane series.\n\nThis kinetic visual novel is not a story based on conflict, but loaded with a deep understanding of the human and beyond and hints at transformative choices in life.\n\nThe first time Luzi meets the black dragon named Knight he says, “I am here so you can pass on the truth of the human’s dark side and to clear up your own. I am here so you can pass on the truth of what people call their dark side. This has to be integrated into the trinity which is your I Am, your Master Wisdom or soul that is your wisdom gathered through all your lives, and your human self.”\n\nSekhmet is back in the family as the cat Boomer, but now also as the black lion goddess when she teams up with the black dragon. New entities and creatures will also join the family, and other changes emerge.\n\nLuzi finds out what our mind and memory really are, and how Artificial Intelligence at some point will create human emotions.\n\nLuzi and Ju-long’s daughter, Julia, play a vital role in building the local village into an influential part of a much greater area.\n\n[From [url=https://eriqa-queen.itch.io/the-truth-of-the-black-dragon]Itch.io[/url]]","developers":[{"id":"p14366","name":"Eriqa-Queen"}],"aliases":[],"title":"The Truth of the Black Dragon","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/11/63811.jpg"}},{"id":"v41851","description":"Based on book 5 of 5 in the Luzi Cane series.\n\nThe kinetic visual novel is not based on drama and conflict, but loaded with a deep understanding of the human and beyond, and hints at transformative choices in life.\n\nLuzi gets intimate with her crystal dragon as it clears every room in the house of her soul.

It has been ten years since they were the talk of the nation.\n\nI still remember it as clear as yesterday when birth rates which had been gradually declining since the 80s became a critical social issue when we entered the new millennium. The government viewed it as a serious social problem, and with the nation at stake they took measures to bring it back from the brink of a crisis.\n\nDid you know phenethylamine, also known as the love hormone, is key to the mechanisms involved in falling in love at first sight?\n\nThe hormone which is produced in the pituitary gland was successfully manufactured artificially. After significant improvement, it was developed into a drug and named the \"new love hormone\". The media reported it as a \"nutraceutical that increases chances of finding your genetically compatible match of the opposite sex\" and was soon added to all food products circulated in the nation. This human subject research, termed the Millennial Revolution, had become a controversial historical event, but soon after the revolution was enforced birth rates and marriage rates showed sky-rocketing recovery. It was thought we had overcome our crisis…\n\nHowever, the new love hormone (PEA) was reported to have a number of serious side effects. A certain number of people complained of suffering from insomnia, a symptom consistent with that of love sickness, and a loss of appetite. Those who also suffered from a deterioration in judgement due to damage to a part of the brain are who society refers to as yandere men. We cannot deny that these men, who are gradually becoming a social issue, are too the victims of the revolution.\n\nFrom an article published in Twisted Disorder Monthly Magazine.\n\n[From [url=https://doropyan.wordpress.com/2022/01/30/yandere-town/]Doropyan's blog[/url]]","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/47/64647.jpg"},"title":"Yandere Town","developers":[{"id":"p17194","name":"Kanisuke"}],"aliases":[],"id":"v42424"},{"id":"v42426","aliases":[],"developers":[{"id":"p17196","name":"Sillyfart"}],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/50/64650.jpg"},"title":"Beasts of Chi No Mizumi","description":"The story is set in a world where humans have canine features.

Their leader introduces themself as Xen and explains that they are space travelers with the objective of saving the worlds they encounter.\n\nXen asks Ekiya about the problems on Earth and all Ekiya does is answer seemingly innocent questions about the world including the uneven distribution of wealth. Little does she know, her answers will soon influence the fate of the entire world.\n\nThe following day, Xen makes a proclamation: every day a progressively increasing number of the wealthiest individuals on Earth would be killed. At first, there are attempts to fight back. However, the superiority of the aliens' technology quickly becomes clear. The world is completely at their mercy-- and perhaps, Ekiya's.\n\nXen seems to trust her judgement and continues listening to Ekiya's advice. Can Ekiya change Xen's mind? Convince them to leave?

Once bearings are found and introductions are made, the school's unusual principal finally reveals himself: Kingpen, the Crowned Al-Capone Penguin. Despite his cuddly looks, he thrusts the entire group into a no holds barred killing game.\n\nWho will die? Who will survive? Who is pulling the strings?

But she's a Katheryn who isn't drawing attention to herself in a way that will have people going for her head, and that's fine ... even if it means she doesn't have any friends apart from her cousin.\n\nA group project threatens to change that, as she's forcibly paired with the most insufferable guy in her music class: lazy, self-important, and flirtatious Harry Iverson.

He derives more pleasure from solving the mysteries that Gilligan writes for him. \n\nOne day, Gilligan and Butler learn about a Detection Club at the university. Both intrigued, they decide to go there and become members themselves.\n\nAt the same time, a series of murders have been taking place on the Diamond University campus. Young college-age women are found dead, always with the heart ripped out from a gaping wound. None of the hearts have been found, evidently stolen from the girls by the killer. Thus, the killer has been nicknamed \"The King of Hearts.\"\n\nTensions have grown on campus as the female students fear becoming the next victim, and the male students fear being falsely accused as the killer. In the midst of all this, Gilligan falls in love with one of the girls, but lacks the confidence to pursue her.\n\nEventually, a new victim is discovered: a member of the Detection Club.\n\nAnd the prime suspect?

He is very rich and noble, but leads a rather closed lifestyle. It's no wonder: what kind of madman would take a rabbit as a butler, and hire a fish as a personal servant?

Zahir is a friendly Mawbreaker who never backs down from a challenge. They’re both a long way from home, and the stories of their pasts hang heavy on their shoulders. Still, they dive into the mystery of the area without hesitation or demand for a reward, and Leone works alongside them to the best of their abilities, learning more about them along the way. \n\nPerhaps Soleil can be the place the pair finally decide to settle down in?\n\nPerhaps it will be just another stop on their journey.\n\n[From [url=https://stygianeyedev.itch.io/the-woeful-rose-the-bitter-crow]Itch.io[/url]]","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/12/66912.jpg"},"title":"The Woeful Rose & The Bitter Crow","aliases":[],"developers":[{"name":"Stygian Eye Stories","id":"p16726"}]},{"description":"You are captain Orson, the captain of the Oxygenerator.

What's it like to work as a cop in Detroit when there's a catastrophic shortage of manpower, the labs are woefully under-equipped, the equipment is obsolete, and the city has zero cameras that can easily help you find a criminal and point out where he's hiding? Well, it's a hell of a job, but he did the best he could. \n\nThe main case in his career would be the investigation of a series of murders commited by a man nicknamed the \"Heartbreaker\".\n\nSince 1993, the Heartbreaker has brutally murdered children between the ages of four and seven every couple of months. To begin with, he slit the throat of a child who was still alive and then cut his heart out of his chest. Despite the brazen nature of some of the murders (i.e, children being abducted straight from their homes while family members were present) no one has actually seen the Heartbreaker. Moreover, he is extremely cautious and cunning. \n\nUp until the beginning of the plot, the police have no fingerprints or DNA of the perpetrator. Adrian has been working for several years as part of a task force that deals exclusively with the case of the Heartbreaker.

A lot of these actors were born already in the business and carried out the roles passed onto them by their elders.\n\nIn Post Scaenam we get to meet these actors and actresses behind their masks and get an intimate view of their daily-lifes off stage; more-so, how taking on an imposed role can impact a person's life.\n\nPierre is a 22-year-old boy, raised in a family involved in the theater in 1680. Since the day he was born he was raised to take on the role of the character “Pierrot” in the theatre.\n\nHis mother, Barbara, having inherited the family business for generations, is blinded by her own ambitions, expectations for Pierre's future, and the way she herself was taught: to uphold the tradition of theatre, from generation to generation, imposes on his son the same life and the same fate, not understanding Pierre's progressive demotivation for the show business. Due to this, Pierre lives in dismay, feeling that he is losing more and more of his sense of self with each passing day. The actors around him seem content with their lives, thinks Pierre, despite having the same fate, but is that the reality?\n\nWill Pierre manage to find someone who shares the same feelings?

The way things are going, I wouldn't be surprised if next time they breach the walls of one of the free cities, and maybe then we'll all finally be ready to admit the truth: it's over for us.\n\nBut maybe not even then. I tell you, these people are in such denial. You know what they say? They say, 'Have faith. God will save us.' Will He? I'm not so sure. In fact, I think He's made it pretty clear He does not give a damn about us. He could've saved us centuries ago. Why the wait? To test us? C'mon, let's be serious now. The first red moon came, and what did He do? He gave us Fire. He said, 'Here, this'll protect you.' And then - poof! - He vanished. Hasn't been heard from since. He left us. Left us to fend for ourselves. That's what people don't realize. That is the thought they will not let themselves have.\n\nAnd, listen, it's not like I don't get it. It's hard to admit you've been abandoned. It's more comforting to believe there's someone out there who cares about you, who'll show up in your time of need. But there isn't. There's no one. It's just us. The sun is going down, and all we got here at the end of the day is each other. So, I guess that'll have to do.\"\n\nWe Carry the Fire is a visual novel set in a world that is slowly ending. Every few years after the new moon disappears from the night sky, it will return red, and when that red moon is full every town, village, and city in the Empire will be attacked by spectral monsters called Shades. The only weapon the people have in their defense is Fire, an ever-burning white flame believed to be a gift from God Himself.\n\nPlayers follow Ashe, a young person whose red eyes mark him as an outcast. When a new red moon appears, Ashe volunteers to deliver Fire to a remote farming village that would otherwise be destroyed under the full moon. This mission will be particularly dangerous because it requires him to cross the Forest, a mysterious wilderness believed to be home to spirits and monsters of myth.\n\nBut Ashe will not face these dangers alone. He is joined by a party of other outcasts like himself: Blaise a former knight excommunicated from her order for an alleged heresy; Kol, an Alfar of the Forest exiled from his clan for breaking a taboo; and Luz, a magical prodigy expelled from her university for stealing secrets from restricted texts.\n\nThe trials they encounter in their journey will push each of them to their breaking point, and to overcome them they must face things they had tried to keep in the past.\n\n[From [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2408090/]Steam[/url]]","developers":[{"name":"Myna Games Ltd.","id":"p19133"}],"aliases":[],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/29/68929.jpg"},"title":"We Carry the Fire"},{"description":"It's been exactly one month since Jaden Black was shot and betrayed by Jasmine Miles.
