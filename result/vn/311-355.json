As Clara matures, Letitia finds her feelings towards her maturing too – until, in the end, she can no longer bear it.\n\nDriven to distraction by Clara’s sensuous brown eyes and her sweet, seraphic laughter, Letitia soon begins to question her sanity. Fearful that, eventually, something within her might snap, and she will do something she regrets, Letitia is bidden to leave her former place of employment, and to seek out work elsewhere.\n\nFortunately, Letitia soon discovers, in the pages of The Morning Post, a job offer which will grant her a means to escape her predicament. The Langley family are searching for a governess for their daughter, the unruly Genevieve – and, best of all, the family resides in the isolated Yorkshire moors, which seems as far away from London as it is possible to get.\n\nUpon reading this advertisement, Letitia soon decides to hand in her notice.

He was the second son of Oda Nobuhide, a deputy shugo (military governor) with land holdings in Owari Province. Nobunaga lived a life of continuous military conquest, eventually conquering a third of Japan before his death in 1582. His successor, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, a loyal Oda supporter, would become the first man to unify all of Japan, and was thus the first ruler of all Japan since the Onin War.\n\nIn the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku (\"Warring States\") period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo.

On the day of the reception, at Edo Castle, Asano drew his short sword and attempted to kill Kira. His reasons are not known, but many purport that insult was involved. For this, he was sentenced to commit seppuku, but Kira went without punishment. The shogunate confiscated Asano's lands (the Ako Domain) and dismissed the samurai who had served him, making them ronin.\n\nNearly two years later, Oishi Kuranosuke Yoshio, who had been a high-ranking samurai in the service of Asano, led a group of forty-six/forty-seven of the ronin (some discount the membership of one for various reasons.) They broke into Kira's mansion in Edo, captured and executed Kira, and laid his head at the grave of Asano. Then they turned themselves in to the authorities, and were sentenced to commit seppuku, which they all did on the same day that year.

The game is set in the late 1990s in the fictional Hirumi City, a stereotypical Japanese neighborhood with shopping districts, hospitals, construction sites, and parks. Although never stated, it is implied the city was born out of Japan's economic boom during the 1980s and has since fallen into disrepair. The story follows three junior high school students exploring urban legends in their city, typically with a paranormal theme. The students are a boy named Nao and his dog Meros, as well as two girls, Kurumi and Sango.\n\nEach chapter consists of two phases, first collecting rumors at the school and then later investigating them in the city. The player can choose one of the three characters to play as when starting each chapter, a choice which will affect how the story proceeds. The player is allotted five minutes to listen in on rumors at school. Each character has different friends, so may hear different rumors. There are 44 total rumors in the game. After this, the player has ten minutes to investigate any rumors by exploring the city, searching suspicious places, objects, and people. The player can consult the other characters at any time, and view information on rumors they have collected in their journal. They can also browse an in-game map of the city to aid in exploring, or use a physical map that came packaged with the game. The dog, Meros, will typically explore the city with the characters and will stop in his tracks if he senses anything strange. In some situations, the game switches to a 360-degree panorama mode, where the player can look around freely.\n\n[From Wikipedia]","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/39/51739.jpg"}},{"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/38/51738.jpg"},"description":null,"developers":[],"id":"v33137","aliases":["PsyInv"],"title":"Psychological Investigation"},{"title":"Ace of Gifts","aliases":["Holiday Market"],"id":"v33138","developers":[{"name":"Gray Lofi","id":"p12904"}],"description":"It's a cold December afternoon, and Sophie has just received an out-of-nowhere text from her girlfriend, Annette, inviting her to the seasonal holiday market.

Her walls are covered in posters of Luluna’s smiling face, and she owns several Luluna figures, much to the bemusement of her best friend, Nina.\n\nDespite Mayo’s intense, borderline obsessive love for Elf Forest, she’s content to pine after her fictional waifu from afar – that is, until one day, when a friend of her family’s, Sae, offers Mayo an incredible job offer.\n\nSae works as a publisher at a company called Horizon, which – as it happens – is the very same company which publishes Tsuchimi Rui’s Elf Forest.\n\nSae tells Mayo, to her disbelief, that she knows Elf Forest’s elusive author personally – and, what’s more, she’s worried about them. Rui has been in something of a slump during the last few months, and the creation of Elf Forest’s ninth volume has stalled. Sae is looking for a housekeeper to take care of Rui’s chores, so Rui can focus exclusively on their writing: a job she decides to delegate to Mayo.\n\nMayo, of course, is overjoyed at the prospect of meeting her idol, and instantly accepts – but soon, she learns Tsuchimi Rui isn’t at all like she imagined.\n\nContrary to Mayo’s beliefs, Tsuchimi Rui is not a middle-aged man, but a young woman only a few years older than she is: a reclusive, awkward hermit who, despite being sub five feet tall, has a biting tongue and a needle-sharp personality.\n\nThis woman’s real name is Komikado Hijiri – and, at Sae’s behest, Mayo finds herself living under Hijiri’s roof.\n\nMayo and Hijiri get off to an uneasy start, but as time passes, the pair begin to grow closer. Mayo begins to grow fond of Hijiri, yet still, she finds herself wondering: who is her real waifu?

At the eastern end of the country of Temirana, about fifteen years ago, a baby with a bruise on her forehead was born as the third princess. The baby was said to be cursed and was forced to live separately from her family in a mansion away from the castle. Eventually, her life came to a big turning point. One day, when her sixteenth birthday was just around the corner, at the venue of the Helis Duellum duel tournament, she saw five men shining in a dazzlingly strong light.\n\nYes, this cursed princess has a special power. When her life is in danger, things and places shine, as if to tell her to avoid them. Those around her who knew of said power suggested that these men might be shining because they're dangerous... but their light was different from the one she had seen so far. Believing in her intuition, the princess decided to invite those who seemed to shine into her knighthood order. But some of them have no experience in swordplay, nor are they even interested in being knights.

In order to put a stop to this chaos, the Grand Sorcerer - a man known only as Huey - decided to build five altars across the land, each implanted with a gigantic gemstone which would allow him to regulate and seal away these imbalanced elements.\n\nFrom then on, every dozen or so years, Huey and his clan members would set out on a journey to maintain the gemstones and seals at each of the five altars.\n\nHowever, twenty years ago, Huey suddenly disappeared. With no one to maintain the altars, the elemental harmony he had created started to disintegrate. Soon monsters started appearing in all corners of the land. As the elemental spirits fell into disarray once more, Klein became plagued with natural disasters and the dreaded Dead Zone began to spread.\n\nThen one day, two familiars, created many years ago by Huey, used a secret technique to summon a man from another world. They instantly recognized him as a descendant of their master - and maybe… just maybe, he's the hero they've been waiting for.\n\nAfter arriving on the Klein Continent, Eiden discovers he must take over Huey’s duties and learn how to regulate his own essence levels. If he can release the seals on his clan members through engaging in various sexual activities, he might just be able to restore power to the neon gemstone and find a way back home…\n\n[From [url=https://game.erolabs.cloud/bl/landing_page_en.html?id=24&lang=en]Erolabs[/url]]","developers":[{"id":"p13423","name":"Infinity Alpha"}],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/22/53522.jpg"},"id":"v34078","title":"Xin Shijie Kuanghuan","aliases":[]},{"id":"v34079","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/08/53308.jpg"},"developers":[{"id":"p3371","name":"agony/Kinshiiku"}],"description":null,"aliases":[],"title":"Irusu Nemuri"},{"id":"v34080","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/91/73991.jpg"},"description":null,"developers":[{"name":"agony/Kinshiiku","id":"p3371"}],"aliases":[],"title":"Odekake Nemuri"},{"aliases":[],"title":"SAGO","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/09/53309.jpg"},"developers":[{"name":"agony/Kinshiiku","id":"p3371"}],"description":null,"id":"v34081"},{"aliases":[],"title":"Nimono Cinderella","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/90/73990.jpg"},"developers":[{"name":"agony/Kinshiiku","id":"p3371"}],"description":null,"id":"v34082"},{"title":"Zangyou Cinderella","aliases":[],"id":"v34083","description":null,"developers":[{"name":"agony/Kinshiiku","id":"p3371"}],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/10/53310.jpg"}},{"id":"v34084","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/11/53311.jpg"},"developers":[{"name":"agony/Kinshiiku","id":"p3371"}],"description":null,"aliases":[],"title":"Shouwa Cinderella"},{"aliases":[],"title":"Douga Cinderella","id":"v34085","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/12/53312.jpg"},"developers":[{"name":"agony/Kinshiiku","id":"p3371"}],"description":"Thirty-year-old Saki is not very good at making eye contact with people when talking to them.\nIn an attempt to overcome this difficulty, she started talking about becoming a YouTuber....\n\nA slightly different and heartwarming story?\n\n[translated from [url=https://www.freem.ne.jp/win/game/21340]Freem![/url]]"},{"id":"v34086","developers":[{"id":"p4007","name":"HAN-RAN-GEN"}],"description":null,"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/13/53313.jpg"},"title":"Kaisha no Dekiru Senpai no Chinpo","aliases":[]},{"title":"Sekai Deruri de Shinsekai","aliases":[],"description":null,"developers":[{"name":"Nitto","id":"p8594"}],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/14/53314.jpg"},"id":"v34087"},{"id":"v34088","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/15/53315.jpg"},"description":null,"developers":[{"name":"Nitto","id":"p8594"}],"aliases":[],"title":"Naon Change"},{"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/19/53319.jpg"},"developers":[{"name":"Nitto","id":"p8594"}],"description":null,"id":"v34089","aliases":[],"title":"Menhera Bit"},{"aliases":[],"title":"Otokano ~Otouto no Kanojo ga Bunkei de Tsuyome!?~","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/96/54396.jpg"},"developers":[{"name":"North Box","id":"p9864"}],"description":"It’s a summer night.

That’s how much respected she was at school.\n\n“What are you doing here?” \n\nChisa apparently asked her to come see how I was doing and help out, since she couldn’t, being on a trip and all.\n\n“Like, don’t let it bother you, ok? I’m more than glad to listen to my cute little sister’s request!”\n\n------\n\nShe very gently takes off my clothes, to wipe my body. Her soft mellow hands carefully trace my body, her sweet fragrance wafting near me. \nI naturally get an erection.\n\n“Ah! You must have bottled up, being like this for so long.” \n\n“yeah well, I mean, I usually have Chisa take care of it for me.”\n\nHer hand wiping my body stopped, then slowly swept down, and started unzipping me.\n\n“Now she isn't here to ‘take care of it’. let me do it in her place. No, I have to do it. I did accept her request to take care of you, and I have to show it.”\n\n“No I can’t do anything to betray her trust…”\n\n“It’s fine really. It’s not cheating as long as you don’t penetrate.”\n\n\n[Translated from [url=http://www.getchu.com/soft.phtml?id=1181881]Getchu[/url]]","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/81/56781.jpg"},"id":"v36134"},{"title":"Kininaru Torihikisaki no Jimuin-san to Ecchi Dekiru Koto ni Nattara...","aliases":["If The Customer Has A Fixation With An Employee"],"developers":[{"name":"Kotatsu no Tsukaima","id":"p14389"}],"description":"A visual novel-like story of an innocent, cute OL who has sex with a client.\n\n[From [url=https://www.dlsite.com/maniax/work/=/product_id/RJ151097.html/?locale=en_US]DLsite English[/url]]","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/56/56456.jpg"},"id":"v36135"},{"id":"v36136","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/58/56458.jpg"},"description":null,"developers":[{"name":"Neo Cut Ball","id":"p14390"}],"aliases":[],"title":"Injoku NTR Doujou ~Atashi, Furyou-tachi no Hentai Mazo Benki ni Narimashita~"},{"aliases":[],"title":"Private Detective: Obannon's Curse","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/59/56459.jpg"},"developers":[],"description":"Three detectives are tasked with finding a serial killer, whom everybody believes to be a vengeful spirit, but those brave enough to help could end up being the killer themselves.\n\n[From [url=https://siraggy.itch.io/private-detective-obannons-curse-prologue]Itch.io[/url]]","id":"v36137"},{"developers":[{"name":"Horo Games","id":"p11371"}],"description":"In parallel time and space, Tokyo, a megacity where the real estate foam has not burst, experiences life as a producer of GALGAME games.\nThe huge city of Tokyo, has brought many different possibilities for work and life.\nProducers can walk on the streets of Shibuya at night, take the Yamaguchi line, visit Ueno Park after the rain, or the maid cafe in Akihabara electric street.

A casual observer would no doubt assume they’d been living this way for a decade or more, given how close they all are.\n\nAs the end of August approaches, the town shopping district is beginning preparations for a festival to mark the end of summer. This will be the first summer festival ever experienced by dragonkind. Meanwhile, for humanity (and one unfortunate girl in particular) this summer festival presents a once-in-a-lifetime chance to make special memories.\n\nYet unbeknownst to our protagonist, a shadow is looming.\n\"I cannot allow the likes of that human to deceive my Haru-chan! She’s the future of dragonkind!\"\n\nWith that cry appears the big, bad Nether Princess Mei (hereafter, simply Mei.) The world now faces yet another threat. But that’s a story for later.
