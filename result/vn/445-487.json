Despite being a small nation, they have remained fiercely loyal to Rydner since its founding, producing numerous high-ranking government officials and ministers. The story's heroine, Delphina Lindbaum, ascends to the throne at a young age after her sickly father's passing.\n\nTo quell her subjects' unease about the sudden emergence of a new queen, Delphina swiftly demonstrates her prowess in both domestic and foreign affairs. Her beauty and competence as a ruler earn her the adoration of her people, who affectionately dubbed her the \"Queen of Linica Crystal\".\n\nThree years into her reign, just as everything seems to be going smoothly, disaster strikes. In the neighboring ally of the Golas Kingdom, a military force calling itself the Golas Revolutionary Army staged a coup, massacring the royal family and seizing control of the government. With lightning speed, they launch an invasion of Linica.\n\nThe Kingdom of Linica, with its limited territory and modest military might, had long relied on trade and diplomacy, leveraging its abundant mineral resources like Aconstone and Linica Crystal. However, this proves to be their Achilles' heel, and the royal capital swiftly falls to Golas' unexpected large-scale invasion. Queen Delphina, heeding the advice of Elza, the royal guard commander, attempts to escape the palace with Mariel, one of her loyal guards.\n\nHaving narrowly escaped, Delphina and her companions seek refuge in a vast forest known as the \"Forest of Spirits\". However, en route, they are spotted and surrounded by the pursuing revolutionary cavalry. Against eight skilled horse riders, only Mariel stands a chance in combat.\n\n\"Ah, even though everyone has sacrificed so much for me, is this where it all ends?\" Delphina murmurs, gazing up at the sky. At that moment, an arrow pierces through a cavalryman's forehead, sending him tumbling from his steed. The cavalry, rattled by the sudden ambush, fall one by one as long-range arrows find their mark with deadly precision. In mere moments, they are annihilated.\n\n\"Could it be that you've come to our rescue?\" Delphina calls out towards the depths of the forest. From the shadows, a boy emerges.\n\n\"Rescue? I merely saw a wealthy-looking woman under attack and decided to help. Since I saved you from a tight spot, I expect to be compensated accordingly.\" The dark-skinned, pointy-eared boy—a dark elf—coldly informs her that his aid comes with a price.\n\nThis marks the fateful encounter between Iron, the dark elf of the Spirit Forest, and Delphina, the Crystal Queen. What does the future hold for this unlikely pair?\n\nDelphina, the Crystal Queen.\nMariel, the elf who swears unwavering loyalty to her queen.\nLeila, the dancer who, believes in the queen's return and hides alone in the royal capital.\n\nIron, a dark elf shunned and despised by society, harbors a deep distrust for humans and elves alike. This tale unfolds as Iron's path intertwines with these women, his interactions with them shaping the course of their journey. Despite being an outcast, Iron's heart is no different from that of humans and elves.\n\n――LIKE to LOVE――\nAs Iron spends time with these women, he learns to open his heart, care for others, and experience the thrill of falling in love. \n\nSet on the same stage as \"Hahamusu\", the Rydner continent, this is a story of love, passion, and adventure. Unlike Remnant, the protagonist of Hahamusu, Iron has no status or renown to his name—he is but a simple hunter. And so, the curtain rises on the extraordinary adventure that awaits this unlikely hero.\n\n[Translated and edited from [url=https://www.getchu.com/soft.phtml?id=1244923&gc=gc]Getchu[/url]]","id":"v46287"},{"id":"v46288","title":"HOTEL HIMA","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/01/69601.jpg"},"developers":[{"name":"kinada","id":"p19337"}],"aliases":[],"description":"One day, a boy named Stepan (Styu) wakes up and realizes that this is his last night at home.\n\nHis mother tells him that he is moving to a hotel for a month.

These creatures target females, and their bodily fluids are lethal when injected into humans. This crisis prompted the development of a technology to absorb and harness the energy of demon beasts, but it's highly unstable. To optimize this method and avoid wasting resources, researchers developed the S-TRAN(C)XE System, also known as the Succubusystem, which can repurpose absorbed energy into an enhanced suit. During the system's first human trial, the research facility was attacked by demon beasts, leading to chaos and the death of a girl.

She was captured by its creators, but eventually managed to flee with the help of the science technician Amy. The two girls suddenly find themselves teleported to a fantasy world, and must find a way to return home.\n\nForesight Dolly is a role-playing game that can be described as \"light\". The player controls Dolly who travels through interconnected areas, most of which consisting of dungeon-like passages. Dolly can equip a weapon and one item as armor. Enemies are visible on screen, and contact with them triggers a turn-based battle, where Dolly can attack physically or use special techniques. Experience and money are gained from combat. The game also has a day and night cycle; Dolly and Amy would automatically go to sleep late in the evening, restoring Dolly's hit points.\n\n[From [url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/61633/foresight-dolly/]Moby Games[/url]]"},{"description":"Last Guardian ~Juukyou no Shugosha~ is set in a fantasy world ruled by gods and inhabited by many different races. Many years ago, two of the gods fought each other, until the god Gaduros emerged victorious, imposing a harsh rule over the nation of the Winged Beasts until the beautiful goddess Typhon defeated Gaduros.\n\nIt looked like the age of peace finally began. But when the Beasts discovered an ancient disc-like artifact, everything went wrong again. A warrior from the nation of Centaurs and a mysterious religious cult suddenly became very interested in the artifact, making it clear to the Beasts that they will have to fight for their lives. And so three of them – two young friends, Rezak and Maxen, and their older comrade Badio – started a dangerous journey across the world, to find out what their enemies' intentions truly are...\n\nThe game is a mixture of RPG and strategy. As in most RPGs, the player controls a party of characters (up to 7), who gain experience points from fighting enemies and level up. However, there is no exploration of any kind and no movement outside of the battle field in the game.\nThe game consists of long strategic battles and cut scenes, most of which are presented as still anime-style shots that advance the story. The turn-based battles allow free movement on the battle field. Each action (movement, physical attack, spell, etc.) requires a certain amount of action points.\nBeside the usual attacks, some player-controlled characters can transform into various types of beasts. While in \"beast mode\", the character gains access to new abilities, but might lose some of those he/she had while in human-like form.\n\n[From [url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/44429/last-guardian-jukyo-no-shugosha/]Moby Games[/url]]","aliases":[],"developers":[{"name":"Studio Inferno","id":"p19980"}],"title":"Last Guardian ~Juukyou no Shugosha~","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/32/103732.jpg"},"id":"v47441"},{"aliases":[],"developers":[{"id":"p19980","name":"Studio Inferno"}],"title":"Last Guardian 2 ~Yomi no Fuuin~","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/00/71200.jpg"},"description":"Last Guardian 2: Yomi no Fūin is a direct sequel to the first game in the Last Guardian series. It continues the unfinished story of the first game - the adventures of a group of heroes from the Beast nation. The sequel focuses on two of the previous game's main characters, Badio and his sweetheart Miriana. Traveling by ship, the couple arrives in a small city in the Eastern continent, where they meet a dying warrior from the Dragon tribe, who is holding a child in his arms, begging the heroes to bring him safely to his people. But Badio and his friends know it won't be easy, when they are attacked by a group of Beast Hunters, and when the powerful enemies continue plotting their schemes against the heroes...\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to that of the first game, with a few minor changes. As before, there is no exploration or movement outside the battles; the entire game consists of long strategic fights and cut scenes. Once again, the player has access to beast transformation for the characters in the party. The player-controlled characters level up automatically, but this time can level up in the middle of the battle. The \"Defend\" command is now available, requiring 1 action point. Some changes were made to the interface (different icons, design of the menus, etc.), but otherwise, nothing essential has been changed compared to the previous game.\n\n[From [url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/44435/last-guardian-2-yomi-no-fuin/]Moby Games[/url]]","id":"v47442"},{"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/01/71201.jpg"},"title":"Long Zhong Kun Shou","developers":[{"id":"p19981","name":"Yici Xing She"}],"aliases":["Trapped in a Cage"],"description":"The primitive people only realized the fear of no moonlight when they first entered the cave, and the damp atmosphere of a lack of fresh air declared their isolation from freedom.

Naturally, he encounters evil forces who won't let him reach his goal; and that's how the thief turns into a hero who will eventually save the world...\n\nSorcer Kingdom (no relation to the similarly named Genesis/MegaDrive game) can be described as a \"pseudo-RPG\". The premise and the structure of the game (top-down navigation, vast dungeon-like areas, towns, etc.) imply role-playing elements; however, these are too light to consider the game a \"true\" RPG. Rather, it contains exploration segments and dialogue alongside action-based battles. The battles aren't very frequent, and can even be set on auto; they are confined to a small area and are triggered whenever an enemy is near the hero. There are no experience points, equipment, or comparable RPG system.

Most of all, he remembers Cadgan: a wolf a bit younger and smaller than himself — an unrepentant troublemaker who left in him a bundle of emotions.\n\nBut that was nine years ago, when he was just a teenager. Upon his return, Hector finds the town transformed by the new duke's reign, and a Cadgan that has grown into a cold, distant mountain of a man. As he works as a healer and reignites a long-forgotten passion, Hector notices something other than love in the air.\n\nThe trees' roots stir with his every step.\n\nDevil's Gambit is both a romance story and an unorthodox mystery.

Though their close relationship sometimes raises eyebrows, he brushes it off as nothing more than a lifelong friendship. Given Marin's vibrant social life, it wouldn't be surprising if she already had a boyfriend, believing it wouldn't affect him in the slightest.\n\nOne day, after playing games and chatting with Marin, he glances at his screen later on and realizes she forgot to turn off the camera. To his shock, he spots his childhood friend in her room with an unknown man, giving him a titjob. She's surprisingly unfazed when she later discovers he witnessed the steamy scene. She drops another bombshell: the guy, Shitaka Eiki, isn't her boyfriend but a friend with benefits.\n\nThe protagonist is shocked not only to learn that Marin is having sex with someone else but also that she has several other fuck buddies. He urges her to quit fooling around, but Marin calls his bluff, suggesting he's just itching to get laid himself. In a bold move, she gives him a blowjob and takes his virginity while he's unable to resist.\n\nFrom that moment on, the protagonist can't shake Marin from his thoughts, and he grapples with conflicting emotions about her promiscuous lifestyle. He makes another attempt to persuade her to ditch her numerous sexual partners, but she accuses him of wanting to monopolize her body. She proposes he joins her roster of sex friends if he's that keen to jump her bones, but he adamantly declines, insisting that's not what their bond is meant to be.\n\nAfterwards, the protagonist continues agonizing over his relationship with Marin while she begins to flaunt her intimate encounters with her sex friends at every turn as if deliberately provoking him.\n\n[Translated and edited from [url=https://www.getchu.com/soft.phtml?id=1268954]Getchu[/url]]","title":"Bitch ni Natteita Ore no Osananajimi ni Tsuite ~Ore to Marin to Sex Friend~","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/64/73464.jpg"},"developers":[{"id":"p1224","name":"Atelier Sakura"}],"aliases":[],"id":"v49163"},{"id":"v49164","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/65/73465.jpg"},"title":"Hidden Signs of Love","aliases":["HSOL"],"developers":[{"id":"p20812","name":"Alice"}],"description":"Embark on a journey of love and chilling discovery in \"Hidden Signs of Love,\" a captivating dating sim visual novel.

The peace of the last decade satisfied most for a time, though the crisis on Akitik Street a few short years ago destroyed the colony's economy. The desperate times since have fueled countless competing ideologies and movements, some of which are already making moves toward action, while others elsewhere have toppled governments. The fuses have been lit,  and the colony stands as a powder keg in the center of it all.

Despite being born into a rich family, he honestly finds his own life rather boring. Failing class and constantly getting into fights all day, his delinquent nature makes the other students scoff at him, seeing him as rather plebeian or barbaric.\n\nHowever, this boring disruptive life of his is about to come to an end. One day he opens up his postal box as usual, expecting to find junk mail, but to his surprise, he finds a package sent to him by his Father. Opening the package, he finds two things; a letter by his father and a book called \"The Art of Hypnotism\".\n\nBored Shuyaku doesn't care about what the book has to say, so he just tosses it aside and forgets the whole thing...until the very next day when his next door neighbor and childhood friend, Saki Itsuka, comes over to his place, noticed the book, and felt intrigued by it. She decides to dare Shuyaku on whether or not he could hypnotize her. He accepts the challenge out of boredom, but his boredom quickly turns upside down as he actually manages to Hypnotize her.\n\nShocked at how easy it was, he decides to use it and make his life just a little more interesting. To see how far he go with this skill, he sets his sights on the school he is attending, deciding to use his newfound abilities to potentially take over the School in a fun little game of sorts. Little does he know, however, was that this was exactly what his father predicted would happen. Now he sits back and observes how far his son will go in an experiment of sorts.\n\n[From [url=https://pleromagroup.itch.io/the-hypnotists-experiment]Itch.io Page[/url]]"},{"id":"v50263","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/89/81789.jpg"},"title":"Shen Zui Jiang Lin","developers":[{"name":"NBDR Games","id":"p21507"}],"aliases":[],"description":"In the middle of September, the Horiverti Residence in the suburban hills suddenly bustled with energy.\n\nThe owners of the villa, the Hartson sisters, saved a boy and a girl from a dark alley.

Portraits of the wealthy and powerful line the streets, attempting to cover up the heinous crimes they've committed.“\n\n\"Is it truly brightness and warmth that meets you after suffering?\"\n\nThe story is set in the city of Devon, the country's only mega city. Plagued by a glaring wealth gap, Devon eventually divided into the Uppercity, where company execs and corpos live amidst opulence and luxury, and the Undercity, where factory workers and gangsters, including triads, dwell.\n\nA decade ago, a phenomenon of unknown origin resulted in the sudden emergence of superpowers among individuals in and around the city, primarily among teenagers. However, this unexpected development presented a formidable challenge for the government, as these superpowered individuals started to engage in criminal activities. In particular, they targeted the Uppercity due to deep-rooted inequality, resorting to acts such as kidnapping and murder of the wealthy.\n\nTo tackle the rising crime rates, the government is compelled to implement two bills: the Vigilante Act and the Superpowers Act. The former empowers selected individuals with superpowers to go beyond traditional law enforcement measures to combat criminals, while the latter treats superpowered individuals differently from regular humans, eliminating age restrictions and establishing dedicated prisons for them.\n\nOver time, superpowered crime in Devon steadily decreased thanks to the state-funded Vigilantes who are entrusted with the task of upholding justice. However, as the Vigilante force expanded, the balance started to shift as some Vigilantes with concealed motives became a new source of instability in the city. Additionally, after the initial surge of superpowers, no new superpowers have emerged in Devon. This results in a growing public demand for the abolition of the Vigilante Bill, and a change in public perception of Vigilantes from once-revered heroes to a more critical stance.\n\nIn such a setting, where you are a member of the Vigilantes, are you truly willing to let others dictate your fate? I believe the answer is unequivocally \"Never.\" Every decision you make, whether significant or seemingly inconsequential, has the potential to impact the relationships and alliances you form during your journey.\n\nIs it to live fleetingly like a mayfly in this superficially vibrant city, or to leave a lasting legacy as a legend in the streets?\n\n\"The power to determine your destiny rests in your hands.\"\n\n[From [URL=https://jasonton.itch.io/mayfly]itch.io[/URL]]","aliases":[],"developers":[{"id":"p21534","name":"Jason Games"}],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/67/75067.jpg"},"title":"Mayfly","id":"v50307"},{"id":"v50308","aliases":["My Insect Girl"],"developers":[{"id":"p21535","name":"IFOnly"}],"title":"My Insect Girl Can't Be This Cute","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/42/98942.jpg"},"description":"You play as the main character, who happens across Ophelia in an abandoned city.
