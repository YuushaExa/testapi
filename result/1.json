Although the Revolution brought with it new laws and some semblance of representative government, there are some places that never change: the dark hole known as prison. Into that hell a boy called Guys is sent. The crime is murder, and the sentence, life without the possibility of parole.\n\nHowever, Guys is innocent of this crime. He was living his life as he always did, running through the city and stealing to survive when he was caught by a policeman. Before he knew what was happening he was accused of a crime he knew nothing about, hauled before a dishonest judge and found guilty of the heinous crime. But just who was killed, and why?\n\nIn prison, Guys is made to endure a world of violence and betrayal as he fights desperately to survive. Inside that world of fear and loathing, he endures in his quest for justice for himself. He finds help in unlikely places -- from alcoholic lawyers and insane men in the prison with him. Eventually he begins to realize the scope of the diabolical plot he's fallen into, but even as he works to uncover the truth, he despairs of that which he has lost. And every day, he struggles for dignity and survival, while the powerful interests who put him here look on with smirking amusement.\n\n\"I just want to be free...\"\n\nWill his strength and determination be enough to break through the hearts of his fellow prisoners?

Then residents of the city slowly changed into beings that are partially human and partially animal.\n\nTo this day, only a few still look fully human on the outside. One of these is Guy, a former medical student, now an illegal doctor that walks the city and cures the poor for free. He changed too, but only in the inside and his change enabled him a mysterious ability that he uses to heal people that keep mutating further every day.\n\nHe has a few 'friends' if you can call them that.

At first glance, he is a fairly ordinary young man who lives an (almost too) ordinary life. He lives at home with his two sisters, Mizubashou and Shirotsumegusa, constantly gets into arguments with his next door neighbor Hinagiku, goes to school with all three and spends the days enjoying life in a virtually perfect world.\n\nThere are, of course, some oddities. Firstly, the only humanoids in the world seem to be Ichihiko, his older sisters, Hinagiku and their teacher, Kobatomugi-sensei. Everyone else looks like something resembling old sci-fi movie drone robots that communicate by repeating the phrase \"oui monsieur\" known as saberhagen-class droids (and are understood the same way Star Wars characters understand the beeps coming from R2-D2). This is a world where it never rains. Where weather conditions are always convenient. Where Ichihiko's favorite shows are always on TV and his favorite foods are always served. Yes, this world is clearly fake.\n\nAs the story progresses, the player discovers that Ichihiko is actually the \"last mankind\" (in other words, the last human left in the universe). He was found in a stasis capsule by the robots that inhabit the spaceship Saint Exupéry-go. Feeling that he is too young to govern over the ship and perform his role in bringing about the second coming of humanity, the robot R-Mizubashou proposes that he be awakened and raised by them, and that a suitable \"happy\" world be built just for him; a world where he has a loving family, lots of friends and feels no hardships or pain.\n\nHaving been without any humans to serve for nearly a millennium, the robots draw upon on almost every possible source to build what is to be Ichihiko's perfect world. To this end, they have used data from \"older\" robots on board, books, movies and even manga. While the majority of the robots involved willfully continue the ruse (and do everything they can to dispose of dissenters), there are some who wish to tell the \"last mankind\" the truth.\n\n[Taken from a [url=http://moroboshiyuumei.livejournal.com/17740.html]review[/url] by Moroboshi Yuumei]","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/52/28552.jpg"},"id":"v418","aliases":[],"developers":[{"name":"light","id":"p242"}]},{"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/51/29051.jpg"},"title":"Koitore ~Ren-ai Training~","description":"The main character is Yuu, who has just entered a high school.

Annoyance. The encounter quickly brings two monumental facts to life: the first is unequivocal proof that vampires exist; the second is revelation of Jun being the sole heir of a royal linage that rules over them. Years ago, Id Demon Brandle – Jun’s vampiric father and would be future emperor – ran from his aristocratic duties to hide among the humans, eventually falling in love with a Shinto priestess named Ogishima Yukari. For reasons unknown, Jun’s father abandoned his mother during pregnancy, and upon this act, Yukari placed a magic seal on her unborn child, locking away the infant’s supernatural abilities. Following the tragic death of his mother four years earlier, the spell has been slowly unraveling, awakening Jun’s latent powers and allowing the vampire nation to determine his location and deliver an ultimatum: Jun would be allowed to continue his existence and assume the mantle of command over his people, but only under the guidelines of three conditions. Condition One: He would be placed under the watch of Elshlant D. Annoyance, serving as his evaluator and mentor in the ways of the vampire. Condition Two: The newly awaken Nosferatu would need to perform a deed that proved him worthy of the inheritance. Condition Three: He would take a bride from one of the noble families to ensure the continued survival of the royal bloodline. As one can imagine, Jun is quite taken aback by all this.\n\nIt quickly becomes apparent to Jun, that the life of a vampire is far more perilous than he could possibly imagine. As he learns that many of the legends concerning the powers and weaknesses of Nosferatu are outlandishly erroneous – mostly due in part to the vampires themselves spreading such fictional myths – the young noble is forced to completely reevaluate his own existence while needing the assistance of an experienced vampire in the process. Were the difficulties of self discovery not challenging enough, Jun inevitably finds himself caught within a deadly web of intrigue thanks to the machinations of rebellious factions within vampire society. \nIt also becomes clear that humanity is not entirely ignorant of the supernatural world that hides from them, and agents of an ancient powerful organization dedicated to the extermination of “hellspawn abominations” violently pursue his destruction. These factors make it imperative for Jun to maintain as low a profile as possible: for his own safety and innocent human friends. Unfortunately, keeping a low profile is not something his enemies are going to allow. Then there’s the whole matter of marriage…\n\n[Taken from [url=http://www.erogereview.com/2008/03/20/draculius/]Eroge Review[/url] blog]","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/57/26357.jpg"},"id":"v453","aliases":["Dorakuriusu","ドラクリ"],"developers":[{"name":"Meromero Cute","id":"p256"}]},{"id":"v454","aliases":["Tsui Teru"],"developers":[{"name":"C: drive.","id":"p239"}],"title":"Tsui ☆ Teru","description":"Riku moves to an apartment.

This is where the series gets its name: Ar tonelico is the name of that tower. As well as humans, the tower is home to a race of human-like artificial beings named Reyvateils, who can communicate with the tower by singing songs to cast magic.\n\nThe story starts in the city of Platina, during an outbreak of enemy creatures called Viruses. The protagonist, a Knight of Elemia named Lyner Barsett, goes to investigate with fellow knight Ayatane, and the tower administrator, Shurelia. Unfortunately, they rapidly discover that the Viruses are able to turn intangible, rendering normal defeat impossible. Shurelia therefore sends Lyner on a quest for the only thing that can help them: the Hymn Crystal Purger. Taking an airship, he travels down to the Wings of Horus, the floating continent that surrounds the tower. More accurately, he crashes thanks to an attack from a dragon, which complicates matters extremely.\n\nIn the process of searching for the crystal and a way to repair his airship, he meets and teams up with a number of people, including two Reyvateils. First is the shy Aurica, who healed his injuries after his crash. Second is the more outspoken Misha, actually his forgotten childhood friend. But there's one problem - Misha looks much younger than she should be. Aside from those two are the wanderer Jack, the local church knight Radolf, and the airship grathmelder Krusche. As the story progresses, Lyner and his comrades not only try to find the Hymn Crystal and fix Lyner's airship, but discover the reason for Misha's youthful appearance, and the source of the recent Virus outbreak.\n\n[From [url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArTonelico]TVTropes[/url]]","title":"Ar Tonelico ~Sekai no Owari de Utai Tsuzukeru Shoujo~","developers":[{"name":"Gust","id":"p910"}],"aliases":["Ar tonelico: The Girl Who Continues to Sing at the End of the World"],"id":"v700"},{"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/69/52169.jpg"},"title":"Natsuzora Kanata","description":"There is a small island.

Trials last 3 days at most, due to the large number of cases that the courts must deal with; if the accused cannot be found innocent after this time, their case is consigned to a higher court. The majority of the work during a trial is on the shoulders of the defense attorney who must cross-examine the witnesses brought forth by the prosecution to find contradictions in testimony to clear their client.\n\nThe playable character is Phoenix Wright. He is a rookie lawyer fresh out of law school in the first game, taking a position at Fey & Co.

After Lee Rekka and his all-female Guren squad have defeated the evil organization of Tetsu (\"iron\") in the previous game, they thought that there would be finally a chance for peace in the old Japan. But then came the assassination attempt on a commander of Guren. The trace leads to the assassin Naotaka. Rekka and his companions have to chase him down, but they aren't ready for another surprise: the remnants of the Tetsu clan raise their ugly heads again...\n\nRasetsu follows the non-RPG template of its predecessor, rather than returning to the RPG roots of the series. A large bulk of the gameplay is the same as in \"Shura\": listening to/reading dialogues, being automatically taken to locations and from time a time participate in pre-set turn-based battles. There is however an important gameplay mode that makes \"Rasetsu\" a strategy game: in dungeons, the player has to throw dice to navigate the hero over top-down corridors with grids. Depending on the number on the dice, the hero advances to different grids, which results in battles, poison traps, items, healing spots, or puzzle pieces that are needed to unravel anime-style pictures of the Guren girls.\n\n[From [url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/guren-tensho-rasetsu]Moby Games[/url]]","title":"Guren Tenshou -Rasetsu-","developers":[{"id":"p485","name":"Zone"}],"aliases":[],"id":"v1043"},{"id":"v1044","developers":[{"name":"Zone","id":"p485"}],"aliases":["blood shadow(dub anime)","crimson lotus"],"description":"The events of the game take place in ancient Japan. Mysterious creatures known as \"ghosts\" appear in the villages, rampaging and killing innocent people. The general in charge of a military action against those creatures builds a special units called \"Guren\", which means \"crimson lotus\". The hero of the game, Lee Rekka (Li Liehuo), is a member of Guren whose task is to find other members (all female) in different villages and to discover the truth behind ghosts' attacks. But the first girl he encounters, the lovely and brave Tsukikage, is abducted by a horribly-looking demon...\n\nThe game is an animé-style RPG with erotic elements. The player visits villages and their surroundings, fighting randomly appearing monsters in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Most of the monsters are female, and they disrobe when defeated. Characters don't gain experience from killing monsters, but from training. Training costs money, which is dropped by enemies or can be gained by doing part-time jobs. Unlike in most Japanese RPGs, the player can choose which attribute (strength, maximum HP, etc.) to raise when training. In the villages, it is also possible to interact with the female party members and influence the hero's relationship with them.\n\n[From [url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/guren]Moby Games[/url]]","title":"Guren","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/74/5674.jpg"}},{"id":"v1045","developers":[{"id":"p485","name":"Zone"}],"aliases":[],"description":"Guren Tenshou: Shura continues directly from where the original Guren ended.

There are still turn-based battles, but they occur only against \"boss\" enemies, when the story dictates it, and involve little strategy but choosing the strongest attacks for all the characters. There are no experience points, no equipment, no items, and even no movement of any kind in the game - it just takes the player from place to place, allowing him only to click on the only available location on the map and occasionally slightly branch the story by making a decision.\n\n[From [url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/guren-tensho-shura]Moby Games[/url]]","title":"Guren Tenshou -Shura-","image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/97/1297.jpg"}},{"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/71/94171.jpg"},"description":"When Mochizuki Hidemitsu, Lord of Azuma and head of one of the great 13 Houses, dies under suspicious circumstances and the lord governing the neighboring Asaka, Ashiya Tatsuyoshi, tries to force Hidemitsu's daughter, Sayo-hime, to marry him, she asks the shinobi of Kasumidanishuu to investigate the death. \nWhile they manage to uncover the truth about the death, this ultimately leads to the annihilation of Kasumidanishuu on the hands of the Meigokutou, a group of Shinobi allied to Ashiya.\nThe survivors rally around Yashiro Jinma, who becomes the leader of the group that Sayo-hime dubs the Yamabukigumi.\n\nAsaka has one of the largest army in the Dragon Realm as well the support of the Meigokutou and apparently the tacit approval of the shogunate.\nOn the other hand the retainers of the Mochizuki house are split on the question whether to fight or to negotiate, is much less militarily focused and the Yamabukigumi is small and disorganized.\nBut they have even stronger cards...","title":"Amatsukaze ~Kugutsu Jinpuu-chou~","developers":[{"id":"p302","name":"ninetail"}],"aliases":["Amatsukaze"],"id":"v1046"},{"title":"Katakoi no Tsuki Extra","description":"One day, some gears of \"time\" are found.

However, many characters and ideas featured in later Rance games originated in Kichikuou Rance.\n\nThe game begins at the start of LP0003. The warrior Rance, accompanied as always by his faithful slave Sill Plain, has been living as the leader of a group of bandits in northern Helman after killing their previous leader as part of a job given to him by the Keith Guild. While Rance greatly enjoys the raping and pillaging that comes with being a bandit leader, the guilt-ridden Sill believes that he is in danger of losing what remains of his conscience and genuinely becoming a villain.\n\nAfter attacking the city of Golak, Rance's group alerts the attention of Ruberan Tser, commander of the Helman volunteer army, who launches a counterstrike on them during their second attempt at pillaging the city. Unable to fight against a genuine army, the bandits are quickly destroyed, Sill is captured by the Helman Army and Rance is forced to flee for his life.\n\nRance evades the Helman army for several days, with both his equipment and health steadily declining all the while, before he finally passes out from fatigue along the Leazas/Helman border. He is found on the verge of death by Kentou Kanami, the personal ninja of Leazas' queen and Rance's longtime admirer Lia Parapara Leazas, who brings him to Leazas castle. After three days of recovery, Rance finally regains consciousness and, completely humiliated by his defeat at Helman's hands and desperate to rescue Sill, demands that Lia give him the Leazas Army to destroy the enemy nation. Finally seeing an opportunity to have Rance to herself, Lia agrees on the condition that he first marry her, which Rance reluctantly accepts. \n\nAs the new king of Leazas, Rance sets his first steps on a path that will lead to either world domination or death. \n\n[Taken from the [url=http://alicesoft.wikia.com/wiki/Kichikuou_Rance]AliceSoft Wikia[/url]]","title":"Kichikuou Rance"},{"description":"Rance 5D, the seventh entry in the Rance series (since there were three \"nr. 4\" games), begins in an embarrassing way for the hero: he is lost in a huge dungeon, with only his loyal and lovely slave Sill to help him.

The dungeon navigation is done from a \"wheel screen\"; the player has to spin the wheel, and as a result Rance and his party will advance to a new location. Even though the player can choose the speed of turning the wheel, and field representing different locations are displayed on it, landing on a new location depends mostly on luck. Rance can encounter a random enemy, find a treasure chest, trigger an event, etc. The battles are somewhat simplified, using a standard turn-based engine without the strategic element of moving on the battle field.
