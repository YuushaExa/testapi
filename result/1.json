[{"description":"A young man named Ibuki is a college student living on his own in an apartment complex. He is also a real cat lover who can't resist taking care of any random kittens he ever comes across of. One night he got visited by a Cat God, who wanted to reward Ibuki for his kindness towards cats. Ibuki wasted no time in his reply: \"I want a cat girl!\" - he said. The Cat God immediately announced that his wish will be granted and then vanished, leaving Ibuki to wonder if it was all just a dream.\n\nSeveral days later, Ibuki is on his way home from work when he discovers that a cardboard box was left near his apartment. A meowing kind of sound could have been heard coming from the box which prompted Ibuki to open it up. Ibuki is shocked to see a beautiful naked cat girl sleeping inside. As she started waking up, she looked up at him and purred: \"I've come to serve you, for all the kindness you've shown to my kind.\" The next thing he knows, his apartment is suddenly filled with all different types of animal girls, all eager to do whatever they can for him.\n\n[Edited from [url=https://www.jastusa.com/lets-meow-meow]JAST USA[/url]]","id":"v1","aliases":[],"title":"Minna de Nyan Nyan","developers":[{"id":"p1","name":"Yamikumo-Communications"}],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/76/81576.jpg"},"screenshots":[{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/07/5707.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/08/5708.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/09/5709.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/10/5710.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/11/5711.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/12/5712.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/13/5713.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/14/5714.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/15/5715.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/16/5716.jpg"}]},{"screenshots":[{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/71/3471.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/72/3472.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/74/3474.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/75/3475.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/76/3476.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/77/3477.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/78/3478.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/79/3479.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/85/187885.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/86/187886.jpg"}],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/03/88403.jpg"},"developers":[{"name":"D.O.","id":"p19"},{"id":"p104","name":"Regista"},{"id":"p829","name":"Takayashiki Kaihatsu"}],"title":"Kana ~Imouto~","aliases":[],"id":"v2","description":"Kana has a terrible disease and has spent most of her life in and out of the hospital.

On his trip to the village shrine he was reunited with his old childhood friend, Minase Itsuki.

As their past and present interweaves, what will fate bring to them ... ?\n\nChapter 2\n\nShirakawa Sayaka comes from a painter's family. Her father is an infamous eccentric painter and all the villagers think that he has a rather odd personality. By extension, his bad reputation has also passed on to innocent Sayaka so she is having a hard time making new friends. Sayaka's one and only enjoyment is to paint with her childhood friend Kamishiro Souji, the only person that she can trust. Her rebellious feelings towards her father, her longing for her deceased mother, and her love towards Souji will all be painted on a blank canvas along with the blooming sunflowers this summer.\n\nChapter 3\n\nMasaki Yoshikazu is starting to feel a little awkward with his girlfriend, Kyouya Touko, and that awkwardness has something to do with his little sister, Masaki Akane. This awkwardness has become a dark spot in his heart which just keeps growing bigger and bigger. The relationship between Yoshikazu, Touko and Akane is heading in an unexpected direction.\n\nChapter 4\n\nInaba Hiroshi had to leave his home as a child and live in an orphanage due to his family-related problems. When he heard that his father became seriously ill, he came back to Tokiwa village on the night of Tanabata (Star Festival). During that night, Hiroshi met a mysterious girl that is holding a black stuffed cat-like toy. The strange girl wearing black clothes and a black hat doesn't remember her own name but none of that will stop Hiroshi from spending more time with the girl and her stuffed cat, Archimedes. Hiroshi's special summer like none other in Tokiwa has just begun.\n\n[Edited from [url=https://www.mangagamer.com/r18/detail.php?product_code=43&af=3a123f6214695bfacaa881bd3117c693]MangaGamer[/url]]"},{"screenshots":[{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/21/9421.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/22/9422.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/23/9423.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/24/9424.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/25/9425.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/26/9426.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/18/13218.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/19/13219.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/20/13220.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/21/13221.jpg"}],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/42/89542.jpg"},"developers":[{"name":"Palette","id":"p10"}],"title":"Moshimo Ashita ga Hare Naraba","id":"v100","aliases":["もしらば","moshiraba"],"description":"To Hatoba Kazuki, Nonosaki Akiho had been an irreplaceable being.
