He is also a real cat lover who can't resist taking care of any random kittens he ever comes across of. One night he got visited by a Cat God, who wanted to reward Ibuki for his kindness towards cats. Ibuki wasted no time in his reply: \"I want a cat girl!\" - he said. The Cat God immediately announced that his wish will be granted and then vanished, leaving Ibuki to wonder if it was all just a dream.\n\nSeveral days later, Ibuki is on his way home from work when he discovers that a cardboard box was left near his apartment. A meowing kind of sound could have been heard coming from the box which prompted Ibuki to open it up. Ibuki is shocked to see a beautiful naked cat girl sleeping inside. As she started waking up, she looked up at him and purred: \"I've come to serve you, for all the kindness you've shown to my kind.\" The next thing he knows, his apartment is suddenly filled with all different types of animal girls, all eager to do whatever they can for him.\n\n[Edited from [url=https://www.jastusa.com/lets-meow-meow]JAST USA[/url]]","tags":[{"id":"g32","name":"ADV"},{"id":"g104","name":"Comedy"},{"name":"Maid Heroine","id":"g112"},{"name":"Protagonist's Senpai as a Heroine","id":"g113"},{"name":"Miko Heroine","id":"g115"},{"name":"Robot Heroine","id":"g126"},{"name":"Male Protagonist","id":"g133"},{"id":"g148","name":"Multiple Endings"},{"id":"g184","name":"Shotacon"},{"id":"g195","name":"Deredere Heroine"},{"id":"g201","name":"Protagonist's Childhood Friend as a Heroine"},{"name":"Nukige","id":"g214"},{"name":"Alternate Dimensions","id":"g250"},{"id":"g278","name":"Cats"},{"name":"High Sexual Content","id":"g304"},{"name":"Catgirl Heroine","id":"g331"},{"id":"g357","name":"Group Sex of One Male and Several Females"},{"name":"Group Sex of One Female and Several Males","id":"g358"},{"name":"Early Sexual Content","id":"g380"},{"id":"g393","name":"Trap Support Character"},{"id":"g407","name":"Sex Under the Necessity"},{"id":"g420","name":"Under the Same Roof"},{"id":"g434","name":"Harem Ending"},{"name":"Butler Support Character","id":"g469"},{"name":"Kemonomimi Support Character","id":"g482"},{"id":"g510","name":"Doggirl Heroine"},{"name":"Rabbitgirl Heroine","id":"g529"},{"id":"g603","name":"Childishly Violent Heroine"},{"name":"Unlockable Harem Ending","id":"g612"},{"name":"Perverted Protagonist","id":"g615"},{"id":"g644","name":"Thief Heroine"},{"id":"g679","name":"Energy Transfer via Sex"},{"id":"g726","name":"Clumsy Heroine"},{"id":"g735","name":"Sex in Public Places"},{"name":"Footjob","id":"g750"},{"id":"g751","name":"Boobjob"},{"id":"g753","name":"Kemonomimi"},{"id":"g829","name":"Waitress Heroine"},{"name":"Wake-up Sex","id":"g832"},{"name":"Missionary Position","id":"g878"},{"id":"g904","name":"Super Deformed CGs"},{"name":"Blowjob","id":"g916"},{"name":"Lactation During Sex","id":"g986"},{"id":"g1053","name":"Heroine with Ahoge"},{"name":"Intercrural Sex","id":"g1080"},{"id":"g1171","name":"Erotic Spanking"},{"id":"g1185","name":"University Student Protagonist"},{"name":"Unlockable Choices","id":"g1234"},{"id":"g1238","name":"Harem Ending with Theme"},{"id":"g1297","name":"Doggy Style"},{"name":"University Student Heroine","id":"g1312"},{"name":"Ejaculation Choice","id":"g1356"},{"name":"Naked Sprites","id":"g1446"},{"name":"Petplay","id":"g1455"},{"id":"g1515","name":"Fingering"},{"id":"g1518","name":"Heroine with Tan Lines"},{"id":"g1580","name":"Excessive Semen"},{"id":"g1581","name":"Cowgirl"},{"name":"Waiting Staff Protagonist","id":"g1599"},{"name":"Bleep Censor","id":"g1676"},{"id":"g1735","name":"Standing Sex"},{"name":"Sitting Sex","id":"g1736"},{"name":"Butterfly","id":"g1738"},{"name":"Landlady Heroine","id":"g1894"},{"id":"g2046","name":"Straight Shotacon"},{"name":"Quickie Fix Position","id":"g2138"},{"name":"Only One Bad Ending","id":"g2202"},{"id":"g2220","name":"Hero(ine) Selection"},{"name":"Double Dildos","id":"g2227"},{"id":"g2228","name":"Sex at School"},{"name":"Heroine with Pubic Hair","id":"g2237"},{"id":"g2249","name":"Tribadism on Penis"},{"id":"g2275","name":"Heroine with Armpit Hair"},{"name":"Footjob on Multiple Penises","id":"g2355"},{"id":"g2589","name":"Threesome"},{"name":"Heroine from a Different World","id":"g2617"},{"name":"Heroine Having Sex with Others","id":"g2920"},{"name":"Rope Bondage","id":"g3039"},{"name":"Vaginal Gaping","id":"g3156"}],"developers":[{"id":"p1","name":"Yamikumo-Communications"}]},{"description":"Kana has a terrible disease and has spent most of her life in and out of the hospital.

Their relation had been changed in the season, and turned into three love stories.\n\nMakoto has been admiring a girl he has seen on the train. That girl is Kotonoha Katsura, and he even managed to take a photo of her with his cell phone. Due to new seating in his class, he ends up next to Sekai Saionji, a nosy, but sweet and sincere girl. As she snoops for his cell phone while talking to him, she discovers his crush and vows to help him until Kotonoha agrees to go out with him. When Sekai finally gets them together, she realizes her own feelings after finding out that the person Kotonoha liked was, in fact, Makoto. While waiting for her train next to Makoto, who was waiting for Kotonoha, she has him talking about how he can repay her for all of her help. Before leaving for her train, she kisses him and cries when she boards the way home. Kotonoha happily arrives for her date with Makoto shortly after. With all three main characters carrying different expressions on their faces, the story begins.\n\n[From

My father came home earlier than usual and said that he's getting remarried.\nThen, the following Sunday. Another rainy afternoon. Two women came to our house. One was a gentle-looking woman, the other... a girl with sorrowful eyes. Father announced them as my new mom and sister.\nFrom that day on, life became a haze of confusion. To put it bluntly, I was lost. The girl who shyly glanced up at me and called me \"big brother\". I’d never properly talked to a girl before, so I had no clue how to handle this innocent, smiling sister.\nEventually, I realized I was thinking about her — Hitomi — constantly. Her pale skin and lips like sakura stuck to the back of my eyelids, flashing behind them every time I closed my eyes. So, that’s why I... assaulted Hitomi, my sister. It happened on a humid, rainy summer afternoon.\n\n[Translated from the [url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041018030602fw_/http://www.cd-bros.co.jp/mercure/soft/01_gimaihitomi/detail.htm]official site[/url]]","developers":[{"name":"Mercure","id":"p23"}]},{"description":"The story revolves around a Japanese sophomore named Kotaro Makimura.

As hopeless as the situation looks to his best friends Ai and Takeshi, he is determined to make Kaho his girlfriend by the end of summer vacation. However, on his way home, he has a collision with a mysterious stranger, and ends up getting covered in a strange multi-colored powder. When he wakes up the next day, he finds himself waking up on September 1st - the first day of the next school year. He also learns that Kaho, who had been his girlfriend, had died in a car accident. Eventually, Kotaro discovers that he has begun day-dropping, in which he skips days, and goes back and forth in time through different days of the summer vacation. With the help of Ligene the Time Patroller (also translated as Lee Jane), Kotaro must win Kaho's heart and prevent her tragic death before he runs out of time.\n\n[From

The strange thing is, Kurame looks exactly like his younger sister Juri...\n\nOn the surface, Itsuki's family and friends all appear to be rooting for his full recovery. However, deep inside, they also seem to be  burdened with secrets and guilt about the past. In the span of four days, Itsuki's memories will slowly return as he struggles between his loss and his fear of the truth, until the fourth night, when the whole world becomes blanketed under a red sheet of snow and wrapped up in the silence of death....\n\n[Translated from the official website]"},{"developers":[{"id":"p988","name":"Kuroneko-san Team"}],"description":"Symphonic Rain takes place in a fictional city of apparently Italian heritage, where rain falls everyday. The locals there have adapted to this peculiar phenomenon, and carry on with their lives as if the rain was never there. No one takes an umbrella, no one wears a rain coat.\n\nThe main character of the story is 17 year old Chris, a Fortelle student of the famous Piova Communal School of Music (Scuola Comunale di Musica Piova, in Italian). Separated from his childhood sweetheart Arietta when he left his home town for the city, he keeps in touch with her through the means of weekly letters. Penning their thoughts on those letters, Chris treasures and keeps her weekly writings, for he had promised her that should his drawer become totally filled with them, he would return to her.\n\nThe game starts during Chris's third year as a student, a few months before he has to take the school's final graduation examination: a staged performance. As an instrumentalist, he is required to search for a vocalist partner before he is eligible for the examination.\n\n[From [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphonic_Rain]Wikipedia[/url]]\n\nBeside the adventure parts that makes most of the game, Symphonic Rain  includes musical sequences. In which the player is required to press keys on the keyboard in correct timing to accompany the current song. These sequences can be turned to automatic if the player doesn't wish to participate.","tags":[{"name":"Magic","id":"g4"},{"name":"ADV","id":"g32"},{"name":"School","id":"g47"},{"name":"Romance","id":"g96"},{"id":"g133","name":"Male

Now, finally, the lunatic novel game which received enthusiastic applause from ... an incredibly small number of rabid Japanese fans ... comes to invade the English-speaking world! This piece will have you going OMG, WTF, and OTL all at once -- and as such it is entirely not appropriate for those under the age of 18 or those with delicate sensibilities. Consider: at different times, it features things like tentacle beast rape, kamikaze suicide attacks, and clubbing baby bears to death with crowbars. Proceed with utmost caution.\n\n[From [url=http://www.insani.org/omgwtfotl.html]insani[/url]]"},{"description":"Minamo is a pure and romantic girl who can be quite clumsy at times, and she's in love with the handsome Satoru, a boy in her class. While working at her part-time job, Minamo spies Ryo and his girlfriend Mio as they eat together, their love for each other clearly visible in their eyes. She wishes she could sit like that with Satoru, but she knows she's too shy to ever come out and confess her feelings to him.\n\nSoon after, Minamo is killed in an accident. Filled with remorse at not seizing her chance for love while she was alive, she visits Ryo and asks for his help. If he'll lend her his own life force, she'll be able to tell her feelings to Satoru. Ryo doesn't know until it's too late that lending Minamo his life energy will turn him into a lifeless spirit!\n\nAnd so the wheels of fate turn, winding the destinies of everyone together: dead Minamo and her reluctant helper Ryo; the pure Mio and her carefree twin sister Mao; the competitive Kokoro, who won't give up Satoru without a fight; the lonely spirit Izumi; and the perplexing Soul Collector. What twists and turns await this cast of characters before the final act is played?\n\n[From [url=https://www.jastusa.com/figures-of-happiness.html]JAST USA[/url]]","tags":[{"name":"ADV","id":"g32"},{"id":"g96","name":"Romance"},{"id":"g104","name":"Comedy"},{"name":"Imouto-type Heroine","id":"g110"},{"id":"g133","name":"Male Protagonist"},{"name":"Multiple Endings","id":"g148"},{"name":"Enforced Playing Order","id":"g149"},{"id":"g154","name":"Loli Heroine"},{"id":"g156","name":"Lolicon"},{"name":"Life and Death Drama","id":"g168"},{"id":"g185","name":"Ghost Heroine"},{"name":"Airhead Heroine","id":"g190"},{"name":"Heroine with Glasses","id":"g191"},{"name":"Modern Day Japan","id":"g221"},{"id":"g236","name":"Low Sexual Content"},{"name":"Hospital","id":"g270"},{"id":"g337","name":"Dramatic Love Triangle"},{"id":"g343","name":"Twin Sisters as Heroines"},{"name":"Nonsense","id":"g351"},{"id":"g380","name":"Early Sexual Content"},{"name":"Reincarnation","id":"g432"},{"name":"Unlockable Routes","id":"g459"},{"id":"g554","name":"Shinigami Heroine"},{"id":"g565","name":"Class President Heroine"},{"id":"g571","name":"Indecisive Protagonist"},{"id":"g596","name":"Nakige"},{"id":"g606","name":"Branching Plot"},{"id":"g633","name":"Other Perspectives"},{"name":"Bad Ending(s)","id":"g672"},{"id":"g676","name":"Flashback"},{"id":"g679","name":"Energy Transfer via Sex"},{"name":"Completely Avoidable Netorare","id":"g684"},{"id":"g694","name":"Body Swapping"},{"name":"Ghost Protagonist","id":"g699"},{"name":"Protagonist with a Face","id":"g728"},{"id":"g829","name":"Waitress Heroine"},{"id":"g848","name":"Death of Heroine"},{"name":"Twin Tail Heroine","id":"g875"},{"id":"g877","name":"Game Over"},{"id":"g878","name":"Missionary Position"},{"name":"Protagonist in Relationship","id":"g880"},{"id":"g894","name":"Sixty-nine"},{"name":"Super Deformed CGs","id":"g904"},{"id":"g905","name":"Sounds of Copulation"},{"id":"g1025","name":"Lots of Choices"},{"name":"Possession","id":"g1041"},{"id":"g1184","name":"High School Student Protagonist"},{"name":"More Than Seven Endings","id":"g1251"},{"name":"Doggy Style","id":"g1297"},{"id":"g1313","name":"Reverse Netorare"},{"name":"Protagonist's Girlfriend as a Heroine","id":"g1333"},{"name":"Central Heroine","id":"g1335"},{"name":"Infidelity","id":"g1380"},{"name":"Outdoor Sex","id":"g1393"},{"name":"Colored Name-tags","id":"g1434"},{"name":"Naked Sprites","id":"g1446"},{"id":"g1457","name":"Netorare Type A"},{"name":"Shimaidon with Twins Ending","id":"g1983"},{"name":"Unlockable Hero(ine)","id":"g2033"},{"id":"g2075","name":"Gentle Protagonist"},{"name":"Unavoidable Heroine Death","id":"g2147"},{"name":"Laid-back Heroine","id":"g2394"},{"name":"Unnamed Heroine","id":"g2491"},{"name":"Pragmatic Heroine","id":"g2513"},{"name":"High School Student Heroine","id":"g3171"}],"developers":[{"name":"AngelSmile","id":"p53"}],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/30/60630.jpg"},"title":"Shiawase no Katachi","aliases":[],"id":"v54","screenshots":[{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/58/5658.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/59/5659.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/60/5660.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/61/5661.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/62/5662.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/63/5663.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/64/5664.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/65/5665.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/66/5666.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/67/5667.jpg"}]},{"aliases":[],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/63/163.jpg"},"title":"Ishika to Honori","screenshots":[{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/60/76260.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/61/76261.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/62/76262.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/63/76263.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/64/76264.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/67/76267.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/68/76268.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/69/76269.jpg"}],"id":"v55","tags":[{"name":"Sexual Content","id":"g23"},{"id":"g32","name":"ADV"},{"id":"g65","name":"Fighting Heroine"},{"id":"g80","name":"Magic/ESP Combat"},{"name":"Miko Heroine","id":"g115"},{"id":"g133","name":"Male Protagonist"},{"id":"g139","name":"Fighting Protagonist"},{"id":"g147","name":"Drama"},{"name":"Multiple Endings","id":"g148"},{"id":"g154","name":"Loli Heroine"},{"id":"g401","name":"Protagonist with Glasses"},{"name":"Harem Ending","id":"g434"},{"id":"g474","name":"Kemonomimi Heroine"},{"name":"Password System","id":"g673"},{"id":"g728","name":"Protagonist with a Face"},{"id":"g985","name":"Priestess Heroine"},{"id":"g1258","name":"No Backlog"},{"id":"g3159","name":"Straight Lolicon"}],"description":"You are Araka, a Dispatch Coordinator for the Paranormal Defense Force (PDF).

regular student with no particular plans for the future - until my parents left for Hawaii on a business trip last fall, leaving me in the care of my uncle in the wintry countryside of Hokkaido.\n\nSmall-town life on Japan's northern island didn't have time to get dull, as from the moment I got there I was reunited with my cousin and childhood friend Saki. She's pretty demanding, but when I'm hanging out with her and her school friends I don't mind; as I get close to them I feel like I'm finding meaning in life that I didn't know I was looking for.\n\nLegend says there is a flower that blooms here in the depth of winter... as the twilight deepens and a snowflake melts in the palm of my hand, I stand with a beautiful girl by my side.

Unlimited is unlocked after you get the endings of the two main heroines (Sumika and Meiya) in Extra.\n\nMuv-Luv Extra:\nShirogane Takeru is a typical high school student with a lazy attitude and a love for the virtual reality mecha battle game Valgern-on. Even though he didn't really want it, he is popular in school mainly due to his daily fights with his osananajimi (Sumika) attracting too much attention. His life takes an unexpected turn when he finds a girl (Meiya) he doesn't remember ever meeting in his bed one morning. That girl is later revealed to be the heiress of one of the biggest zaibatsu. She immediately moves to his house and starts changing his life for the good with her one-track-mind and unlimited resources...\n\nMuv-Luv Extra, the main part of Muv-Luv, takes place in the same world (and general area) as Kimi ga Nozomu Eien and Kimi ga Ita Kisetsu. The Sky Temple family restaurant is mentioned and visited, and Suzumiya Akane makes an appearance.\n\nMuv-Luv Unlimited:\n[spoiler]One day Takeru wakes up late, wondering why Sumika or Meiya didn't wake him up this morning. Not seeing any signs of them he gets a bit worried and goes out of his house only to see the town he lived in all his life in ruins.

of Tokiwa.\n\nChapter 1\n\nKazama Akira recently came back to Tokiwa village with his mother. On his trip to the village shrine he was reunited with his old childhood friend, Minase Itsuki. Their reunion brought back all kinds of memories from the times when they were still playing with each other and generally had a good time together. As their past and present interweaves, what will fate bring to them ... ?\n\nChapter 2\n\nShirakawa Sayaka comes from a painter's family. Her father is an infamous eccentric painter and all the villagers think that he has a rather odd personality. By extension, his bad reputation has also passed on to innocent Sayaka so she is having a hard time making new friends. Sayaka's one and only enjoyment is to paint with her childhood friend Kamishiro Souji, the only person that she can trust. Her rebellious feelings towards her father, her longing for her deceased mother, and her love towards Souji will all be painted on a blank canvas along with the blooming sunflowers this summer.\n\nChapter 3\n\nMasaki Yoshikazu is starting to feel a little awkward with his girlfriend, Kyouya Touko, and that awkwardness has something to do with his little sister, Masaki Akane. This awkwardness has become a dark spot in his heart which just keeps growing bigger and bigger. The relationship between Yoshikazu, Touko and Akane is heading in an unexpected direction.\n\nChapter 4\n\nInaba Hiroshi had to leave his home as a child and live in an orphanage due to his family-related problems. When he heard that his father became seriously ill, he came back to Tokiwa village on the night of Tanabata (Star Festival). During that night, Hiroshi met a mysterious girl that is holding a black stuffed cat-like toy. The strange girl wearing black clothes and a black hat doesn't remember her own name but none of that will stop Hiroshi from spending more time with the girl and her stuffed cat, Archimedes. Hiroshi's special summer like none other in Tokiwa has just begun.\n\n[Edited from [url=https://www.mangagamer.com/r18/detail.php?product_code=43&af=3a123f6214695bfacaa881bd3117c693]MangaGamer[/url]]","screenshots":[{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/24/1724.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/25/1725.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/26/1726.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/27/1727.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/87/2587.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/88/2588.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/89/2589.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/92/2592.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/73/160873.jpg"},{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/sf/74/160874.jpg"}],"id":"v99","aliases":["Wet Summer Days"],"image":{"url":"https://t.vndb.org/cv/60/95660.jpg"},"title":"Suika"},{"developers":[{"id":"p10","name":"Palette"}],"tags":[{"name":"Sexual Content","id":"g23"},{"name":"ADV","id":"g32"},{"name":"High School","id":"g48"},{"id":"g96","name":"Romance"},{"name":"Brother/Sister Romance","id":"g100"},{"id":"g104","name":"Comedy"},{"id":"g115","name":"Miko Heroine"},{"name":"Male Protagonist","id":"g133"},{"id":"g147","name":"Drama"},{"id":"g148","name":"Multiple Endings"},{"id":"g168","name":"Life and Death Drama"},{"id":"g185","name":"Ghost Heroine"},{"name":"Protagonist's Sister as a Heroine","id":"g226"},{"name":"Dramatic Love Triangle","id":"g337"},{"name":"Curse","id":"g548"},{"id":"g567","name":"Sword Wielding Heroine"},{"id":"g596","name":"Nakige"},{"id":"g598","name":"Episodic Story"},{"id":"g602","name":"Tsundere Heroine"},{"name":"Branching Plot","id":"g606"},{"id":"g634","name":"Gardening Club"},{"id":"g692","name":"Proactive Protagonist"},{"id":"g728","name":"Protagonist with a Face"},{"name":"Sunflowers","id":"g766"},{"name":"Missionary Position","id":"g878"},{"name":"Protagonist in Relationship","id":"g880"},{"id":"g916","name":"Blowjob"},{"id":"g983","name":"Heroine With Kansai Accent"},{"id":"g1000","name":"Youkai Heroine"},{"name":"Resurrection","id":"g1055"},{"id":"g1229","name":"Heroine with Kimono"},{"id":"g1269","name":"Brocon Heroine"},{"id":"g1333","name":"Protagonist's Girlfriend as a Heroine"},{"id":"g1464","name":"Child Support Character"},{"id":"g3172","name":"Sex with Protagonist Only"}],"description":"To Hatoba Kazuki, Nonosaki Akiho had been an irreplaceable being.
